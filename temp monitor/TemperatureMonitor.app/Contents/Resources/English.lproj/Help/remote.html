<p>Hardware Monitor and Temperature Monitor can also monitor remote computers.
  This means it is possible to contact an arbitrary number of other computers
  over the network, and access their sensors as well. The readings will 
  be displayed in addition to the values of the local sensors.</p>
<p>The only thing you need are additional copies of the application <cite>Hardware
  Monitor Remote</cite> which have to be installed on each of the remote computers
  that should be monitored. You also need a registration key (&quot;license to use&quot;)
  for each computer that should be monitored at the same time. You can connect
  to an unlimited number of computer simultaneously and monitor them all from
  a single workstation. (In practice, the actual number may be limited by the
  speed of your network.) Of course you can also use several monitoring stations
  to receive data from an arbitrary number of other computers.</p>
<p>In the following example, 4 computers are running Hardware Monitor Remote
  while 2 are running Hardware Monitor. Note that one of the system is running
  both applications at the same time. The arrows indicate in which direction
  the sensor readouts are being transferred. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/HardwareMonitorRemote2.png" alt="Hardware Monitor License Model" width="501" height="330" /></p>
<p>In the example above, 5 (not 6)
  registration codes are needed (under the assumption, all 5 computers are running
  at the same time).</p>
<p>There is no gratis version of the remote monitoring tool (no &quot;Temperature
  Monitor Remote&quot;). However, you can use Temperature Monitor to connect to a
  Hardware Monitor Remote system. In this case the application  is limited
  to displaying temperature sensors on the local monitoring computer, but it
  will display all sensors of the monitored remote computer. </p>
<h2>Connecting to a remote computer</h2>
<p>To connect to a remote computer which is running a registered copy of Hardware
  Monitor Remote, use the following instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the menu item <cite>Monitor &gt; Connect to Remote Computer</cite> or
    press the key combination <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>.</li>
  <li>A list of computers which are running Hardware Monitor Remote in the local
      network will be displayed. The list is automatically updated using Bonjour
      technology. Computer names, serial numbers, IP addresses, DNS names, and
    connection status are displayed. Select the computer you want to connect
    to. If the computer is running in a different network, or can only be reached
    via the Internet, it will not be part of the list. In this case, enter the
    computer's IP address or DNS name to the field <cite>DNS name or IP address</cite> manually.
    You can also specify the communication port number of the remote computer.
    Under normal circumstances, the port is 37037. The administrator of the remote
      computer might have changed this number. In this case, ask the administrator
      of the remote computer for the correct port number.</li>
  <li>Press the button <cite>Connect</cite>. You can also double-click a line
    in the table to connect directly to the listed system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hardware Monitor will try to contact the selected remote computer. If it could
  not be reached, you will receive an error message after a few seconds. In this
  case please check your network configuration and the operational state of the
  remote computer. Computers already connected are marked with a blue icon in
  the remote computer list.</p>
<p class="infocell">If the remote computer had never been connected by the current computer before,
  new preference settings for the remote sensors will be added automatically.
  You should open the preferences window and verify if all preferences are set
  as desired. </p>
<p>Additional information can also be found in the reference
  manual of Hardware Monitor Remote.</p>
<h2>Connecting to a group of remote computers</h2>
<p>You can define groups of computers in your network which should be connected
  by a single mouse click. This is helpful when monitoring different classrooms,
  for example. Use this feature by selecting the pull-down menu <cite>Connect
  list </cite>in the lower right corner of the connect window. You can define
  an unlimited number of computer groups which will be connected in one step
  by selecting their respective items in this menu.</p>
<p>To define such a list of computers, select the item <cite>Edit Computer Lists…</cite>.
  A configuration sheet will appear. Press the button <cite>+</cite> below the
  lower table to add a new computer group. The new entry will be shown in the
  hierarchical overview <cite>Computer lists and members.</cite> After select
  a list in this overview, pressing the button <cite>+</cite> again will add
  a new member to that list. You can edit the list names, computer names and
  port numbers as desired. Note that you have to use DNS names or IPv4 addresses
  to refer to a computer. You cannot use the designations called &quot;computer names&quot;
  of Mac OS X. Entries or whole lists can be removed by the <cite>-</cite> button.
  The button <cite>Add selected computers to selected list</cite> can be used
  to automatically refer to one or more computers running Hardware Monitor Remote
  which are currently online in your network. Select a list in the lower overview,
  select one or more computers in the upper table to use this.</p>
<p>After pressing <cite>OK</cite>, the sheet will close and you can use the defined
  computer lists in the <cite>Connect list</cite> pull-down menu.</p>
<h2>Displaying connection status and disconnecting from a remote computer</h2>
<p>You can display a list of all computers which have an active connection
  to your current computer. This list can also be used to release a connection.</p>
<p>Select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show Remote Connections</cite> or press
  the key combination
  <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>. The window <cite>Connected Computers</cite>  will
  appear. It shows the computer names, model types, serial numbers, IP addresses,
  DNS names, and the number of sensors found.</p>
<p>To disconnect from one of the computers, select it in the table and press
  the button <cite>Disconnect</cite>. Note that you cannot disconnect from your
  own computer. </p>
<h2>Sleep mode</h2>
<p>If a remote computer enters sleep mode, all its sensors will be powered down,
  so it is no longer possible to receive current readouts or other information
  from it. The application handles this automatically and will release the connection
  to the remote computer. The monitoring computer will display a warning message
  when this happens. If you don't like to be informed in this case you can switch
  off the warning message using the <a href="prefs.html">General pane of the
  preferences window</a>.</p>
<p>If your own computer enters sleep mode, the situation is a bit different:
  The current computer can no longer receive readings but the remote computers
  are still acquiring data. In this case the local application will automatically
  try to reconnect to all remote computers as soon as it is waking up.</p>
<p class="infocell">It will take several seconds until all remote computers have been reconnected.
  Mac OS X needs some time to reactivate all network features after it has been
  awoken from sleep mode. </p>
<h2>Working with remote sensors</h2>
<p>The application won't make any difference between local and remote sensors.
  You can add sensors to the desired output channels, remove or reorder them.
  Just open the preferences window and readjust the settings accordingly <a href="output.html">as
  discussed earlier</a>. The fourth column in the sensor tables shows the name
  of the computer each sensor belongs to.</p>
<p>Preference settings for remote sensors will still be stored if you disconnect
  from the computer hosting the sensors. The application will automatically remember
  the settings when you reconnect. Currently disconnected remote sensors
  just disappear from all output channels and will reappear later.</p>
<p>Some status windows automatically open a new copy of the window for each computer
  which is currently connected. This includes the following displays:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sensor Overview Window (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>) </li>
  <li>System Info Window (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>) </li>
  <li>Battery Info Window (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd>), Hardware Monitor only</li>
  <li>Xserve Disk Info Window (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd>)</li>
  <li>Drive Overview Window (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd>)</li>
  <li>Display Info Window (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>9</kbd>), Hardware Monitor only</li>
</ul>
<p>For example,  if you have 5 computers currently connected in addition to the
  local computer, and you select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show Overview</cite>, the application
  will open 6 copies of the Sensor Overview Window, one for each computer. </p>
