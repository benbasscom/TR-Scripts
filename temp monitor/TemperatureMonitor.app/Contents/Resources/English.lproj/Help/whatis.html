    <p>The programs <cite>Temperature Monitor </cite>and <cite>Hardware
        Monitor</cite> are part of an application suite for the Mac OS X
      operating system.</p>
    <p>The applications make it possible to read out all available hardware
      sensors in Macintosh computers, to process their measured values, and to
      store them. The application <cite>Temperature Monitor</cite> is available
      for free, but is limited to accessing temperature sensors only. The
      application <cite>Hardware Monitor</cite> on the other hand is not
      gratis, but can access additional sensors if your computer is equipped
      with them. This includes the following sensor types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Battery data of portable computers</li>
      <li>Voltage sensors</li>
      <li>Current (amperage) sensors</li>
      <li>Fan speed sensors</li>
      <li>Sensors for pulse-width controlled fans</li>
      <li>Power and load sensors</li>
      <li>Ambient light sensors</li>
      <li>User-defined artificial sensors to monitor the operating system </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moreover, the applications can display additional technical information
      about your computer. Among other information this includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processor type</li>
      <li>Processor and bus frequencies</li>
      <li>Manufacturing information of the system</li>
      <li>Manufacturing information of connected screen displays</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course the applications can read out the data only if your computer is
      equipped with the necessary sensors, and if Mac OS X can access them
      without needing third-party device drivers. Beginning in summer 2002,
      Apple has begun to massively drive forward the use of monitoring probes in
      the PowerMac series, the Xserve series, and in portable computers. Some
      models are equipped with 90 and more sensors. But Temperature and Hardware
      Monitor can detect sensors on many older systems as well if they are
      available.</p>
    <p>We try to detect all sensors on as many Macintosh computer types in the
      support time range (see below) as possible. However, a prediction which
      sensors are available in which models is not possible, because Apple very
      often releases "silent product updates", where the hardware equipments of
      some models are changed but the names are not (specifications are "subject
      to change without notice"). The particular graphics card and hard disk
      configuration used is also important because these parts can include
      independent sensors, too.</p>
    <p>Please note that Apple does not support an official or standardized way
      of reading out sensor data in Mac OS X (the only exceptions are the <cite>Server
        Monitor</cite> application for the Xserve series, and the IPMI support
      of the LOM-processor of Intel-based Xserve systems). Moreover, there is no
      documentation or other technical note about the individual function of the
      sensors. For this reason, the development of Temperature Monitor and
      Hardware Monitor is very costly because the necessary data has to be
      determined by reverse engineering and tests run on a variety of computer
      models. Please support the development of the applications by purchasing a
      registration key for Hardware Monitor.</p>
    <h2>Additional applications</h2>
    <p>The distribution packages not only include the full versions of Hardware
      Monitor and Temperature Monitor but also two additional variants of the
      software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>space-preserving Lite versions, which display the readings in the
        menu-bar only, not consuming valuable Dock or screen real estate,</li>
      <li>command-line versions which make it possible to acquire readings at
        the Unix level or in combination with other applications, for example
        via scripts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another application, the add-on <cite>Hardware Monitor Remote</cite>
      allows you to monitor remote computers as well, transferring the sensor
      data over a network. The following table summarizes all available variants
      of the applications:</p>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2>Data output and processing</h2>
    <p>The applications support the following operations on the measured
      readings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>display in a default window</li>
      <li>output in a screen display in front or in the background of the screen
      </li>
      <li>tabular display in an overview window</li>
      <li>display in the menu-bar</li>
      <li>display of a maximum of two readings in the Dock</li>
      <li>graphical display of short-term and long-term history curves</li>
      <li>speech output of readings</li>
      <li>display of minimum and maximum values </li>
      <li>export to text and CSV files</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Compatible operating systems and computers</h2>
    <p>Temperature Monitor and Hardware Monitor run with Mac OS X 10.4 or later.
      This includes system versions named "OS X".</p>
    <p>Using the applications with Mac OS X 10.7, OS X 10.8 or later is
      possible, but due to efficiency problems in Apple's Objective-C runtime
      support shipped with that systems, CPU load may be significantly higher.</p>
    <p>The applications are only designed for use with Apple-branded computers
      released between August 1, 2002 and October 31, 2012. They cannot be used
      with other model series.</p>
