        the previous size preferred by the user until it is being reconfigured.</li>
      <li>The command line version of the program will now use the special
        output value "-" to indicate a sensor which has been detected but cannot
        retrieve any values at the moment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.85 (Build 100208)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the iMac 27".</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.8 (Build 090918)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for Mac OS X 10.3 Panther has been removed. The required
        minimum OS version is now Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.</li>
      <li>Added a feature to reset different aspects of display preferences for
        all sensors back to recommended default values. This new feature
        supersedes the former features to reset sensor display colors, data
        acquisition settings and customized labels.</li>
      <li>Added a feature to display 32/64 bit capabilities of the processor and
        the current mode of the kernel.</li>
      <li>Added a feature to display the unique identifier (UUID) of a computer.</li>
      <li>Added a feature to monitor the size of swap space memory which is
        actually in use.</li>
      <li>Added a feature to let the user define individual sets of remotely
        monitored computers in a network. It is now possible to connect to whole
        groups of monitored systems in one step.</li>
      <li>Added a new driver for monitoring of the internal thermal sensors of
        Intel processors which is also capable of supporting the 64 bit kernel
        version of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.</li>
      <li>On PowerPC hardware, support for S.M.A.R.T. hard drive sensors
        accessed via SATA interfaces has been enhanced. The application will now
        accept the temperature sensors of unknown SATA drive models. (This has
        always been the standard on Intel-based computers.)</li>
      <li>The support for hard drive sensors controlled via proprietary drivers
        of Sonnet and FirmTek has been enhanced.</li>
      <li>By user request, a feature to suppress access to S.M.A.R.T. hard drive
        sensors has been added to the command-line version of the program.</li>
      <li>The output channel "Screen Display" will no longer try to keep its
        screen position if the user changes a multi-monitor configuration while
        the program is not running. This makes sure the Screen Display cannot
        become invisible when its target monitor has been removed.</li>
      <li>The default number of displayed digits behind the decimal point is now
        automatically set to zero in cases where it is known that the sensor
        hardware does not provide more significant digits.</li>
      <li>When exporting readings, it is now possible to also use history
        windows in overlay mode as sources to get combined tables of readings
        for different physical quantities.</li>
      <li>If the application loses the network connection to a remotely
        monitored computer, related warnings will now be suppressed
        automatically when a change of the network configuration on the
        monitoring computer itself is the main reason for the disconnect. This
        is useful when a mobile computer monitoring a network leaves the WiFi
        area, for example.</li>
      <li>When remote-monitoring multiple computers with repaired logic boards
        that have invalid or erased hardware serial numbers, the application
        will now better keep track of the individual identifications of the
        affected systems.</li>
      <li>If the application is set to automatically reconnect to a set of
        remotely monitored computers on startup, the reconnect will now be
        performed less aggressively, one by one. This avoids temporary network
        overload when monitoring a large number of computers.</li>
      <li>When quitting the application, shutdown of attached alphanumeric LCD
        boxes has been enhanced.</li>
      <li>The numbering of labels for user-created sensors monitoring battery
        units will now also start with 1 instead of beginning with 0.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the temperature values displayed for the
        cores of the Intel P7350 processor have been shifted by 15 degrees
        Celsius.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where no spaces between values have been displayed
        in the menu-bar when the display of sensor labels has been switched off.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.7 (Build 090324)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added full support for the new Mac Pro series (March 2009). This
        includes support for processors using Intel® Core™ i7 technology and
        simultaneous multi-threading.</li>
      <li> Completed support for the new iMac and Mac mini series (March 2009).</li>
      <li>The labels for several battery sensors have been changed to be more
        consistent with the labels of other sensors. Numbering will now begin
        with 1 instead of 0. Users of previous application versions can update
        their preferred labels by either browsing through all sensors via <cite>Preferences
          &gt; Sensors</cite> and editing names manually, or by selecting the
        menu item <cite>Monitor &gt; Reset Customized Names for All Sensors</cite>
        for automatic replacement of all labels.</li>
      <li>The detail information windows for G5 processors, x86 processors,
        battery units and Xserve disk units have been modified to begin
        numbering of objects with 1 instead of 0.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.6 (Build 090127)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added new feature to display the current operating temperature of
        battery units and the voltages of each individual cell in a battery pack
        (Hardware Monitor only). This feature is only available for portable
        computers having battery units compliant with the Smart Battery
        Standard, running Mac OS X 10.4.9 or later. When a smart battery is
        available, Hardware Monitor will use a completely redesigned battery
        information panel.</li>
      <li>Added new feature to display product details of connected screen
        displays (Hardware Monitor only). This includes plug-and-play
        identification data and manufacturing date / model year. Users of most
        portable Apple computers can use this data to find out the true
        manufacturer of the system's display panel.</li>
      <li>Added new feature to control the CPU performance needed to coordinate
        access to the Apple System Management Controller.</li>
      <li>Added support for the MacBook (Late 2008), MacBook Air (Late 2008) and
        MacBook Pro 15-inch (Late 2008).</li>
      <li>Added preliminary support for the future MacBook White (Early 2009)
        and the future MacBook Pro 17-inch (Early 2009).</li>
      <li>Added preliminary support for future models of the iMac and the Mac
        mini based on Nvidia chipset technology, expected to be announced in
        2009.</li>
      <li>Added support for "per-core" Digital Thermal Sensors on specific Intel
        Mobile Core 2 Duo processors in 45 nm technology. If supported, these
        sensors replace the synthetic "Core Hot" sensors displayed by version
        4.5x of Hardware Monitor.</li>
      <li>Enhanced compatibility with Intel processors expected to be used in
        future Apple computers.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the application could consume more memory
        than usual when monitoring characteristics of network interfaces via
        customized artificial sensors (Hardware Monitor only).</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the management list of jumpers and switches
        on the main logic board was only displayed as a single left parenthesis.</li>
      <li>Many internal enhancements.</li>
      <li>Many additions to the reference manual.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.51 (Build 080623)</h2>
    <p>This is a maintenance update which reacts to recent developments in Mac
      OS
      X Leopard and fixes minor problems.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added a feature to detect a common damage of Leopard installations
        where users have intentionally destroyed the system's speech synthesizer
        to save storage space.</li>
      <li>The readings of non-working GPU-load sensors provided by some of
        Apple's graphics drivers for Leopard are now correctly suppressed by the
        application. Instead of displaying a constant zero value, the sensor
        will be removed entirely.</li>
      <li>Support for monitoring the frequency of Intel processors based on 45
        nm technology ("Penryn") has been withdrawn. The sensor might not
        reflect the true performance mode under all operating conditions.</li>
      <li>The mechanism to detect ambiguities in machine production dates has
        been optimized. Computers built in 2008 are now always displayed with
        their correct dates of production.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.5 (Build 080312)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for new portable Mac systems with Intel T8000
        processors.</li>
      <li>Added temperature sensor support for the standard PATA hard drive of
        the MacBook Air.</li>
      <li>Support for on-core temperature sensors of Intel processors based on
        45 nm technology ("Penryn") has been modified: As confirmed by Intel,
        the core sensors behave no longer linear enough for the display of
        absolute readings in low temperature ranges. For this reason, support
        for core temperature sensors in 45 nm technology has been removed in
        Temperature Monitor. Hardware Monitor will display them as logical
        sensors showing "Core Hot" status information.</li>
      <li>The application will now detect first generation Intel Core processors
        which are affected by a hardware problem that can cause the core
        temperature sensors to stop working after the system wakes from sleep
        mode.</li>
      <li>Enhanced support for CPU clock frequency monitoring, especially on
        systems with Xeon 5400 processors and MacBooks running Leopard or
        running without a battery unit.</li>
      <li>Added a workaround for a security problem in Mac OS X which affects
        systems containing a GPU of the ATI Radeon X1000 series. In those
        systems, the GPU driver can crash, causing the screen content to freeze.
        Hardware Monitor now tries to avoid situations that could increase the
        likelihood for this defect to become noticable. NOTE: It is our policy
        not to discuss security holes in third-party products before giving the
        vendor (Apple) six months time to fix this problem.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem with the display of Intel processor model codes
        when the model code was greater than 15.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.4 (Build 080211)</h2>

      <li>Added full support for load sensors of Intel GMA X 3100 and ATI Radeon
        X 2000 graphics chips (Hardware Monitor only).</li>
      <li>Added new feature for drives equipped with activity LEDs. To help
        users in identifying drives, it is now possible to let drives light up
        their activity indicators via the Drive Overview window.</li>
      <li>It is now possible to directly connect to remote computers by
        double-clicking entries in the connect panel.</li>
      <li>Sensor labels can now be reset to their initial default designations.</li>
      <li>The FAQ chapter in the reference manual has been revised.</li>
      <li>Many small optimizations in user guidance.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.3 (Build 071024)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added official support for the iMac models published in August 2007.</li>
      <li>Removed support for Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar and other operating systems
        releases prior to version 10.3.8.</li>
      <li>Added support for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.</li>
      <li>The status of the extreme value drawer, ruler mode, and the display of
        curve labels for history windows is now saved to preferences. Each
        history window will individually restore these settings when the
        application is relaunched.</li>
      <li>The markers for showing extreme values in history windows can now also
        be selected via keyboard while the history drawer is open.</li>
      <li>The panel for connecting to remotely monitored computers now uses
        better support for multi-homed systems.</li>
      <li>The application no longer locks its history features when it detects a
        corrupt file for storing long-term history values. In this case the
        damaged data will be ignored and be removed automatically.</li>
      <li>The application now correctly suppresses frequency readings of Intel
        processors when the battery is removed from portable computers and the
        system has switched to restricted frequency control (Hardware Monitor
        only).</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the application did not show the sensor name
        in the user's preferred language for the exhaust fan rotation sensor of
        the MacBook May 2006 model (Hardware Monitor only).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.2 (Build 070619)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the new MacBook Pro series introduced in June 2007.</li>
      <li>Added support for a variety of internal temperature sensors of new
        hard drive models. This affects old Macintosh computers not supporting
        the AHCI standard.</li>
      <li>Users can now create a new artificial sensor type which monitors the
        current number of running processes (Hardware Monitor only). </li>
      <li>Users can now create several new artificial sensor types to monitor
        the network interfaces present in the system. It is possible to monitor
        the current number of incoming and outgoing packets, the current number
        of incoming and outgoing bytes, the current number of incoming and
        outgoing network errors, the current number of network collisions, and
        the total cumulative number of incoming and outgoing bytes. Sensors can
        be defined for each interface (Hardware Monitor only, requires Mac OS X
        10.4 or later). </li>
      <li>Alert panels now display the exact time when the alert situation was
        detected. </li>
      <li>Selected display preferences for the Dock icon can now be set directly
        via the context menu of the Dock icon. </li>
      <li>By user request, the Lite version has a new menu item to immediately
        refresh the display of readings independent of the regular update
        interval.</li>
      <li>By user request, the Lite version has now support for sensor alerts.
        The actions to display alert panels, to play the warning sound, and to
        run external applications are supported. </li>
      <li>The handling of repaired or refurbished Macintosh systems which don't
        have a valid serial number has been enhanced.</li>
      <li>Modified preference values are now committed to stable storage
        immediately when the preferences window is closed. This can reduce the
        likelihood that changes are lost when the application is used to
        diagnose problems on a computer with defective hardware.</li>
      <li>The application now correctly suppresses the display of electrical
        sensors for NVIDIA 7600 GT MXM cards in the 24-inch iMac. In that
        special configuration, the power supply of the GPU cannot be monitored
        (Hardware Monitor only). </li>
      <li>A problem was corrected where artificial sensors for monitoring RAID
        status could only be defined for one subset of a RAID 10 configuration.
        It is now possible to monitor all 3 RAID subsets of a RAID 10 with three
        artificial sensors (Hardware Monitor only). </li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the application could crash when an
        artificial power sensor was created but one of the dependent voltage or
        amperage sensors was removed (Hardware Monitor only).</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the preferences to control an external LCD
        box could not be deleted (Hardware Monitor only). </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.11 (Build 070207)</h2>
    <p>This is a small maintenance update which only enhances minor issues in
      the user interface:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The menu-bar display will now be highlighted when the menu is open.</li>
      <li>It is now possible to delete the full sensor preferences set of a
        remotely monitored computer by a single mouse click when that machine
        has been taken offline and is no longer connected to the local computer.</li>
      <li>Corrects a scaling issue affecting the display of history curves when
        a long term history display had been zoomed out and the window width
        resulted in a horizontal time sampling resolution between 1 and 2
        minutes per pixel.</li>
      <li>The resize behavior of the remote connection window was optimized. </li>
      <li>Enhanced compatibility of the disk saver feature with Mac OS X Jaguar.
      </li>
      <li>The internal hard drive sensor of Maxtor MaXLine Pro 500 (7H500F0)
        drives is now also detected by PPC-based Macintosh systems. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.1 (Build 070104)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for a large number of voltage, current (amperage),
        power, and light sensors for Intel-based Macintosh systems.</li>
      <li>Added full support for the new Apple Xserve Quad Xeon.</li>
      <li>Added support for S.M.A.R.T. temperature sensors in SATA drives
        connected via an SAS bus.</li>
      <li>Removed support for the internal Intel CPU sensor monitoring the
        target value of the core voltage. This is now superseded by the voltage
        sensors monitoring the actual core voltage supply.</li>
      <li>Added new "disk saver" preference which allows users to stop
        monitoring of internal hard drive sensors when the system is idle. Idle
        drives can now enter sleep mode and be held in sleep mode, independently
        of S.M.A.R.T. monitor time interval settings.</li>
      <li>The user interface for drawers in the history windows has been
        consolidated. There is now a single drawer for colors and extreme
        values. </li>
      <li>The color preferences for the visualization of sensors can now also be
        set via the color drawers of history windows.</li>
      <li>Added feature to add small labels to history curves. The labels use
        the sensors' short names configured in preferences.</li>
      <li>Added feature to automatically recover from situations where one
        sensor stopped responding and the application was about to be halted by
        the operating system. (These situations can typically occur in machines
        where hard drives need more than 12 seconds to wake up from sleep mode,
        or where third-party applications are blocking the ATA busses for
        extended periods of time.) When such a situation is detected, the
        application will automatically stop all its activities, allowing the
        operating system to resolve the problem. After a certain amount of time,
        the application will reactivate itself and resume operation.</li>
      <li>The rounding of readings from frequency sensors of x86 processors has
        been updated according to Intel's recommendations.</li>
      <li>Access to sensors where the user preference "Don't acquire readings"
        was switched on is now prevented completely at the hardware level. </li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the installation of the driver for extended
        x86 sensor support could fail if the application had been put in a
        folder which had a name with non-ASCII characters.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where a memory sensor in portable Core 2 Duo
        systems was misidentified as being a memory riser-card sensor.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the internal temperature sensor of Hitachi
        Deskstar 7K500 drives was no longer seen as functioning sensor.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem in the preference panel where some settings in the
        user interface were not updated correctly when the configuration tables
        for history windows and alerts were only controlled by keyboard, not by
        mouse.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 4.0 (Build 061108)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for a large number of new temperature sensors of
        Intel-based Macintosh systems. This includes thermal diodes monitoring
        the processors externally, GPU sensors, drive bay sensors and FB-DIMM
        sensors of the Mac Pro, etc.</li>
      <li>Added new feature to combine multiple history windows, making it
        possible to put sensors with different quantities into direct relation
        with each other. The user can define overlays for any selection of
        graphs. </li>
      <li>Readings of sensors which have raised an alarm are now displayed with
        warning markers in the sensor window, the screen display, and the
        menu-bar.</li>
      <li>The display of sensor readings in some output channels has been
        optimized further. No additional space is added in front of the readings
        which consumes less screen real-estate and enhances the appearance in
        windows where left-aligned layouts were selected. </li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the curves of history graphs could show a
        flicker effect under very special circumstances.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the speeds of switched-off fans were
        displayed as "---" instead of "0 RPM" on some specific PowerBook models.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where S.M.A.R.T. status probes could not be
        created for drives if the support status of the drives' internal
        temperature sensors could not be determined. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>NOTE: Some specific sensor location labels for Intel-based systems are
      subject to change and may not be final. Compatibility Reports for the new
      Core 2-based Mac series created via the Help menu of Hardware Monitor are
      welcome. Intel Xserve models are not fully supported yet. Support will be
      added when these systems become available.</p>
    <h2>Release 3.95 (Build 061010) - Hardware Monitor only </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to recent efforts in reverse-engineering Apple's System Management
        Controller, it is now possible to support all fan sensors of all
        Intel-based Macintosh systems. The sensors and their parameters for
        permissible limits are found automatically. Additional temperature
        sensors are expected to be supported in the near future.</li>
      <li>The application can now control additional types of external LCD
        displays. The USB modules of the series CFA-632 and CFA-634 from
        Crystalfontz America, Inc. are supported. Additional free device drivers
        from Future Technology Devices International Limited (FTDI) are needed
        to make the modules accessible by Mac OS X.</li>
      <li>The application now contains a "backlight saver" for external LCD
        modules. The timeout intervals can be set individually for each
        connected module. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.9 (Build 060918)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the 4 new iMac series introduced in September 2006.</li>
      <li>Added support for temperature sensors in some old hard drives which
        are not fully compliant with today's implementation of the S.M.A.R.T.
        industry standard.</li>
      <li>By user request, Hardware Monitor now additionally supports monitoring
        of the case security lock for all Xserve systems. The lock position is
        monitored by a logical status sensor, where 1 denotes the normal, locked
        position, and 0 the unlocked setting.</li>
      <li>Artificial sensors to monitor storage space on volumes can now also be
        created for network volumes, not only for local disk partitions
        (Hardware Monitor only). </li>
      <li>If rulers are enabled for history windows, the application will now
        always try to keep the position of the crosshairs, no matter how the
        window or the selected time interval are resized.</li>
      <li>By user request, the old feature to display history curves in a scaled
        down fashion has been reinstated. Clicking on a new zoom button now
        allows to switch between a scaled down time axis, and display in full
        time resolution.</li>
      <li>Output of readings has been optimized to avoid leading blanks whenever
        possible. This produces better output, especially in the Dock and
        menu-bar channels, and in cases where the user has selected a combined
        Celsius/Fahrenheit display.</li>
      <li>The panel to display processor details will now better differentiate
        between logical processors, number of cores per processing unit, and
        physical number of processing units. It will also correctly reflect the
        number of currently deactivated processors.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the marketing name of Xeon 5100 processors
        was not displayed in the processor detail panel.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the application could raise a low sensor
        reading alert when the sensor was temporarily in a disconnected status.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.8 (Build 060825)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the Apple Mac Pro.</li>
      <li>Added support for Growl notifications when defining sensor alerts.
        This makes it easier to receive alert messages by e-mail independently
        of the operating system version. (For more information see
        www.growl.info.)</li>
      <li>Users of large screens can now activate up to 8 sensor displays in the
        menu-bar.</li>
      <li>By user request, sensor readings in the menu-bar can now be configured
        to use the definable sensor display colors.</li>
      <li>The format preferences for sensor readings now allow to define up to 4
        instead of 2 digits behind the decimal point. This change is necessary
        to allow the exact display of core voltages for Intel processors
        (Hardware Monitor).</li>
      <li>By request of many users, history windows are now resizable. The time
        axis is no longer scaled down, so users can scroll over the entire
        history data set in full resolution.</li>
      <li>By user request, the application will now track for each individual
        history window if it was open when quitting the application. Upon next
        startup, the application will restore the exact state of the history
        windows and no longer open all histories if only one was open. For
        roaming network users who use the application on different computers,
        different history window groups for different computer types will be
        respected individually.</li>
      <li>The application can now detect if a processing core of an Intel
        processor was shut down by the user, so the digital thermal sensors of
        that core no longer update their values. The sensor display of the
        affected core will switch to the usual "disconnected sensor" reading
        after some time.</li>
      <li>The application can now detect if it is being launched on Intel-based
        systems before the operating system is fully started. On very fast
        systems which were configured for automatic login and which launched the
        application as a login item, this could cause the program to run before
        the Intel support driver was started by Mac OS X. To avoid this problem,
        the application will now automatically wait 10 seconds for the CPU
        driver to become active.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the display of precision and accuracy of
        temperature sensors could be switched to Fahrenheit (which is
        inappropriate) in the sensor detail panel. </li>
      <li>Corrected a problem of an early build of 3.7 where the application
        could crash when being used on an "Intel® Xeon® 5100 Sequence"
        processor.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem of an early build of 3.7 which did not
        automatically open the history windows on startup if they were open
        during last shutdown.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.7 (Build 060618)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to quality problems and intellectual property issues, support for
        the third-party software "SpeedIt" has been removed. The application now
        comes with its dedicated own driver to access internal information of
        x86 processors. The driver can easily be installed or uninstalled from
        within the application. The program will automatically notify the user
        if installation of the driver is recommended.</li>
      <li>The following additional sensors will be accessible on current
        x86-based Macintosh systems when the driver is active: the internal
        digital thermal sensors for each CPU core of Intel processors, current
        core voltage value of Intel processors (Hardware Monitor only), current
        true clock frequency of Intel processors (Hardware Monitor only).</li>
      <li>In addition, the System Information window of the application will be
        capable of displaying family, model and stepping numbers, as well as the
        internal identification of x86 processors after the aforementioned
        driver has been installed.</li>
      <li>Added new preference values to adjust the ratio of the font sizes for
        display of the sensor labels in relation to display of the sensor
        readings. The preference settings are available for the sensor window
        and the screen display output channels.</li>
      <li>The policy for detecting temperature sensors that are built into hard
        drives has changed: If the application detects a SATA drive under
        control of an Intel-based Macintosh system using AHCI, it will
        automatically assume that this drive contains a working temperature
        sensor compliant with the latest version of the ATA and S.M.A.R.T.
        standards. Up-to-date hard drives will no longer need explicit support
        by the application but will be accepted automatically. The column for
        temperature sensor support in the Drive Overview window has been
        removed. </li>
      <li>The reference manual now gives an example on how to define a sensor
        alert trigger to automatically shutdown the system when readings exceed
        adjustable threshold values. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.6 (Build 060504)</h2>
    <p>By request of many interested customers, this update is published earlier
      than initially intended. You only need to update from 3.5 if you like to
      use one of the following modifications: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to very high demand, this version adds support for the third-party
        software "SpeedIt" by InCrew Software, Spain. SpeedIt is a kernel
        extension for Mac OS X which grants user applications permission to
        access the on-chip CPU temperature sensor of Intel-based Macintosh
        systems. The monitoring application will automatically detect if SpeedIt
        is running on the system. If yes, the features of SpeedIt will be used
        to acquire readings from the CPU. For additional information, please see
        the FAQ chapter of the reference manual. </li>
      <li>Enhanced support for the first generation iBook G4, where temperature
        sensors of the type Analog Devices ADT7460 did not deliver their
        readouts fast enough with specific Mac OS X versions, causing
        intermittent display of zero values. </li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where temperature sensors controlled by the G4
        version of the Apple System Management Unit were displayed as being
        disconnected.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.5 (Build 060428)</h2>
    <p>The following items have been added to Hardware Monitor. They are not
      available in Temperature Monitor:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added new feature to create artificial software sensors which monitor
        aspects of the operating system. This includes the load on each
        processor core, disk usage, free storage space and used storage space
        for each volume, free memory, used active memory, used inactive memory,
        used non-pageable memory, current number of page-ins and page-outs,
        allocated swap space, S.M.A.R.T. drive verification status for each
        drive supporting the S.M.A.R.T. standard, RAID operation status for each
        software RAID set created by Mac OS X, electrical power for
        user-definable pairs of voltage and amperage sensors, remaining battery
        capacity for each battery unit.</li>
      <li>Added new feature to control external alphanumeric LC display modules,
        connected via USB by a Code Mercenaries IO-Warrior USB controller chip.
        Output on the LCD is fully user-configurable. Next to sensor output and
        text elements, an external display box can be configured to show current
        date, time, computer name, kernel version number, OS version number, OS
        build number, IPv4 addresses of all physical network interfaces, and
        bar-graphs for sensors representing percentage values.</li>
      <li>Added a new user preference to allow the sign of battery current
        sensors to change, reflecting whether the respective battery is charging
        or discharging.</li>
      <li>Added support for ACPI-compliant battery units of non-Apple computers.
      </li>
      <li>History records for non-temperature sensors are now automatically
        added in the same user session if Hardware Monitor is switched from demo
        to unlocked mode. It is no longer necessary to restart the application
        to get history data of the previously locked sensors. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following items apply to all variants of the software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for several new S.M.A.R.T. hard drive sensors.</li>
      <li>The format of labels for the y-axis of history graphs has been
        enhanced.</li>
      <li>The policy for the display of alert messages has changed: The
        application no longer locks its user interface until the user has
        acknowledged an alert. If multiple alert messages arrive before the user
        has acknowledged a message, new alerts will overwrite previous ones.</li>
      <li>The panel for computers which don't contain sensors has been enhanced.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.4 (Build 060302)</h2>
    <p>Added support for new Macintosh systems which use the "smart battery"
      industry standard. Production dates and serial numbers of "smart" battery
      units can be displayed in a new battery detail panel.</p>
    <p>Note to users of Temperature Monitor: If you are already using version
      3.3 of Temperature Monitor, you only need to update to 3.4 if you want to
      remotely monitor the battery of a MacBook Pro running a licensed copy of
      Hardware Monitor Remote 3.4. In all other aspects, version 3.4 is
      identical to 3.3.</p>
    <h2>Release 3.3 (Build 060216)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added a new system information detail window for Intel-based Macintosh
        systems. The window displays system management data like component
        serial numbers, hardware details, and vendor information for the
        following categories: Computer system, processors, cache units, memory
        devices, firmware, system mainboard, system enclosure, internal and
        external connectors, expansion slots, onboard devices, and jumpers. </li>
      <li>Added extended support for nVidia graphics cards containing more than
        one equally named temperature sensor. The application now better keeps
        track which sensor is which.</li>
      <li>Added support for hard drive sensors accessed by SATA controllers that
        follow the AHCI standard, which is a new feature of Mac OS X 10.4.4.</li>
      <li>Added support for several new S.M.A.R.T. hard drive sensors.</li>
      <li>Added preliminary support for the iMac Intel Core Duo.</li>
      <li>Added new feature to automatically correct raw firmware sensor labels
        if sensor preferences had been set with an old version of the
        application which did not officially support a specific sensor yet.</li>
      <li>The FAQ chapter in the reference manual has been revised.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the load sensor of the ATI Mobility Radeon
        9700 was erroneously detected as temperature sensor. </li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where roaming network users which access more than
        one computer could not correctly import preference sets from a computer
        of the same model type.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.2 (Build 051125)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the third-generation iMac G5 (iSight). If you used a
        release prior to 3.2 on the new iMac G5, it is recommended to delete
        your preferences file to get updated sensor labels.</li>
      <li>Added support for several new S.M.A.R.T. hard disk sensors.</li>
      <li>Added new option to let history windows show absolute instead of
        relative time designations.</li>
      <li>The extreme value tables in the drawers of history windows will now
        remember their size settings, and the drawers will now open with more
        appropriate initial widths. </li>
      <li>The wait panel of the menu-bar version (Lite application) was replaced
        by a message in the menu-bar.</li>
      <li>The display of detail information for some production sites and the
        Dallas 1631 sensor chip have been optimized.</li>
      <li>The reference manual has been revised.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.1 (Build 051110)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The new version contains a workaround for the problem that Mac OS X
        did not update the readings for some specific low-priority sensors of
        certain Macintosh models. Now all sensor values are refreshed under all
        conditions. This affects temperature sensors of the 15-inch and 17-inch
        PowerBook G4 models released in 2005, as well as the ambient air
        temperature sensors of PowerMac G5 models.</li>
      <li>Added support for the new PowerMac G5 Dual Core systems.</li>
      <li>Added support for the new PowerBook G4 (Super Drive Dual Layer)
        systems.</li>
      <li>Added support for ambient light sensors found in the latest PowerBook
        models (Hardware Monitor only). </li>
      <li>Added support for several new S.M.A.R.T. hard disk sensors.</li>
      <li>The display of the extreme value table in the drawer of the history
        window has been optimized. </li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where keyboard navigation in the sensor preference
        outline view did not update the entry fields.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where curves in the history graphs were displayed
        with the wrong time scale for certain intervals.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the clock frequencies of the local computer
        were displayed in the system info window although a remote computer was
        selected. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.01 (Build 050908)</h2>
    <p>3.01 is a maintenance update which only affects a small minority of
      users. If you are using release 3.0 with a Mac OS X system not among the
      problematic cases outlined below, it is neither necessary nor beneficial
      to download version 3.01.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for Mac OS X installations with incomplete or unusual
        configurations. In particular, this affects the following situations:
        Mac OS X systems where the computer name has been deleted, Macintosh
        computers with repaired or replaced mainboards where the hardware
        personalization fields in Open Firmware were empty, system installations
        that are very slow in waking up from sleep mode.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem wheren the Connect button in the remote connection
        panel might have stayed in disabled mode when you manually entered data
        to connect to a remote computer in a different subnet. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 3.0 (Build 050826)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The application can now monitor remote computers via a TCP network
        connection. The user can connect to an unlimited number of remote
        computers using Bonjour technology. The add-on <strong>Hardware Monitor
          Remote</strong> and an additional registration key for each computer
        monitored simultaneously is required to use this feature. It is not
        necessary that a user has logged in at the remote computer.</li>
      <li>The application has now a multi-threaded architecture and its core was
        rewritten completely. The history curves are no longer interrupted when
        the application waits for a user response in a dialog window.</li>
      <li>The version numbers of Hardware Monitor and Temperature Monitor have
        been synchronized to avoid confusion. (This means Hardware Monitor has
        been updated from release 1.5 to 3.0, skipping version 2.)</li>
      <li>Added new feature to display S.M.A.R.T.-compatibility and S.M.A.R.T.
        verification status of all disk drives.</li>
      <li>Added new feature to display the admissible limits for all sensor
        locations for which Apple's specifications are known. The limits are
        displayed in additional columns in the Sensor Overview window. </li>
      <li>Added new feature to locate and visualize extreme values in the
        history windows. </li>
      <li>Added support for S.M.A.R.T. temperature sensors of several new hard
        disk models.</li>
      <li>Added preliminary support for Intel-based Macintosh systems.</li>
      <li>Added support to differentiate between multi-processor and
        multi-core/multi-thread systems. </li>
      <li>Added a user preference to keep the position of the screen display
        fixed, so users can no longer shift the display by mistake.</li>
      <li>Added user preferences to set customized speech output names for each
        sensor. </li>
      <li>Added feature to let the program open an application or document when
        a sensor alarm is triggered.</li>
      <li>Added feature to change the alignment for the display of readouts in
        the sensor window and screen display.</li>
      <li>Added user preference to change the background color of each history
        graph.</li>
      <li>Added feature to restore the time intervals selected in each of the
        history windows when the application is relaunched.</li>
      <li>Sensor types are now visualized using additional icons.</li>
      <li>The System Information window has been simplified. </li>
      <li>Hardware Monitor has got a redesigned icon.</li>
      <li>The preference window has been redesigned completely. </li>
      <li>Panther systems affected by security problem CVE-ID: CAN-2005-0985 are
        now handled automatically, so user intervention is no longer necessary.
        Defective Mac OS X fan drivers are no longer accessed.</li>
      <li>The application now contains a workaround for a bug in nVidia graphics
        card drivers: If the drivers of GeForce 6800 cards mistakenly report
        that the cards' sensor identifications have changed, the application
        will no longer generate new preference settings for the "new" sensors of
        the supposedly "replaced" card.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where pulse-width controlled fans of GeForce 6800
        cards have been mistakenly reported as fans with RPM sensors.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem with the labels of history rulers where minutes
        and seconds could be confused when a time interval of less than 1 hour
        was monitored with the ruler crosshair.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where not all non-refreshing sensors were detected
        on some specific PowerMac G5 models without liquid cooling system.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where a short-term history window was not updated
        when the sensor update interval was increased in the same user session.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the Dock tile was not restored to show the
        application icon when the user launched the application via a permanent
        Dock entry and had defined a very short update interval. </li>
      <li>Corrected several hyper-links in the English version of the reference
        manual.</li>
      <li>Several new sections have been added to the reference manual. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 2.5 (Build 050228)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added support for the 12-inch, 15-inch, and 17-inch PowerBook G4
        models released in February 2005. Note that current versions of Mac OS X
        are not capable of refreshing most temperature sensor readings of the
        February 2005 15-inch model, and the February 2005 17-inch model.</li>
      <li>Support for temperature sensors of several hard disk models has been
        added.</li>
      <li>Added new feature to display disk monitoring detail data for Apple
        Xserve drive modules.</li>
      <li>Added new feature to display the number of charge/discharge cycles as
        well as the maximum capacity of battery units of portable computers
        (Hardware Monitor only). This feature is only available on Mac OS X
        versions which are capable of supporting this.</li>
      <li>History data and current sensor readings can now also be exported in
        CSV format in addition to text files. </li>
      <li>Because different versions of Mac OS X handle the sign of the battery
        amperage values differently (indicating that the battery is charging or
        discharging), Hardware Monitor will now display positive values only to
        avoid confusion.</li>
      <li>By user request it is now possible to launch the Lite version from the
        preferences panel of the full version. This allows a simple switch
        between the Lite and full version when the user wants to change
        preference settings for the menu-bar display.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem where the option to display readings in Celsius and
        Fahrenheit simultaneously could cause an incorrect display of
        temperature extreme values in the minimum/maximum window.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 2.4 (Build 050128)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for many new hard disk models has been added.</li>
      <li>Support for some previously undetected sensors of the Xserve and the
        Xserve G5 has been added.</li>
      <li>A workaround for a bug in Mac OS X 10.3.7 has been added: On computers
        with incorrect DNS configurations, Panther 10.3.7 imposes a delay of
        approximately 1 minute to applications which have to know the computer's
        TCP/IP name. Among many other programs, Temperature Monitor and Hardware
        Monitor were affected by these delays. The applications will now detect
        this problem and cancel the request after 3 seconds. This allows the
        programs to be used in incorrectly configured TCP/IP networks with Mac
        OS X 10.3.7.</li>
      <li>Alarm triggers for temperature sensors now automatically recompute
        their thresholds when the user switches to a different temperature unit.</li>
      <li>The boot ROM version is now additionally displayed in the system
        overview.</li>
      <li>The application notifies users who have forgotten to define different
        colors for curves in the history graphs.</li>
      <li>Fixes a problem where old readouts could be displayed in the Dock when
        the application was quit.</li>
      <li>Many small changes and optimizations in the user interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 2.3 (Build 041123)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for all sensors of the iMac G5 has been added.</li>
      <li>Support for sensors of nVidia GeForce 6800 graphics cards has been
        added. </li>
      <li>Preliminary support for the sensors of the Power Mac G5 October 2004
        model has been added. Compatibility reports for this model sent with the
        respective option in Hardware Monitor are welcome.</li>
      <li>Support for a large number of additional hard disk temperature sensors
        has been added.</li>
      <li>The floating window has been renamed to screen display window. It can
        now either float on top of all windows (as the previous version), or
        support a new setting "backdrop window", which attaches it to the
        background image of the Desktop.</li>
      <li>A new status window was added which can display minimum and maximum
        readouts of all sensors for a selectable time frame of up to one week.</li>
      <li>An option was added to automatically save history data not only when
        quitting the application but also in a regular, selectable time
        interval. This allows you to save reference data for cases where your
        computer is affected by emergency shutdowns due to overtemp conditions.</li>
      <li>By customer request, the readouts in the sensor window and the screen
        display window have been made user-selectable. So the current values can
        be easily copied to other applications without having to use the export
        feature.</li>
      <li>A new feature was added to move the screen display window back to the
        middle of the screen after you have made layout changes or modified your
        multi-monitor configuration to the effect that the window was placed
        outside the visible screen area.</li>
      <li>Long sensor names in the sensor window or the screen display window
        are no longer cut off if they are very large. The windows automatically
        adjust to the best layout possible. For this reason, window locations
        and sizes may change when you upgrade from a previous release to version
        2.3.</li>
      <li>The preference panel now shows a warning if the access interval for
        hard disk sensors is in contradiction with Mac OS X energy saver
        preferences you have set for hard disks.</li>
      <li>The preference panel allows you to reset the fonts for sensor and
        screen display windows to their default settings. </li>
      <li>The application no longer deletes preference settings of sensors that
        have been removed from the system or are temporarily offline. This also
        includes cases where hard disk temperature sensors have been categorized
        as being unreliable. Sensors which have been removed finally can be
        deleted manually from preferences. </li>
      <li>The filter method that rejects values of unreliable hard disk sensors
        has been optimized.</li>
      <li>The application now automatically detects if the sensor of an offline
        hard disk is reconnected to the system.</li>
      <li>A new menu item which allows an enforced re-scan of the current
        connectivity of sensors has been added.</li>
      <li>Several menu items which open or close status windows have been moved
        from the Monitor menu to the Windows menu to match the user interface of
        future versions of Mac OS X.</li>
      <li>By customer request, the command line version of the application
        contains new options which can be used to generate reports in CSV
        format. </li>
      <li>The panel for demonstration mode has been redesigned completely.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem where the import of sensor preferences for roaming
        users working on several similar hardware models in a Mac OS X network
        did not work reliably. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 2.21 (Build 040924)</h2>
    <p>This is a maintenance update only affecting minor issues.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the sensor window was not resized correctly
        after it was moved off the main screen in a multi-monitor setup, or the
        layout was changed for a position near the screen border.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where the color wells in the preference window
        could not be clicked under certain circumstances.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where alerts were triggered for the wrong
        threshold value.</li>
      <li>The user interface for the warning of an unstable operating system
        version was changed (Hardware Monitor only). It is now possible to set a
        user preference that disables the warning per computer. The preference
        panel contains a new button to re-activate all disabled sensors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 2.2 (Build 040908)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Translated descriptions for some sensors of the PowerBook G4 (12 inch,
        1.33 GHz) and the cooling pumps of the Power Macintosh G5 (dual 2.5 GHz)
        have been added. </li>
      <li>Support for temperature sensors of some hard disks of the Western
        Digital Raptor series has been added.</li>
      <li>If the menu-bar display is switched off, the Lite version of the
        application will now display a small icon in the menu-bar only. This
        reduces consumption of screen real estate for the Lite version to the
        smallest amount possible.</li>
      <li>The font for the menu-bar display can now be configured by the user.</li>
      <li>The acquisition of data can now be disabled by the user for each
        sensor individually.</li>
      <li>Readings of hard disks which send invalid data after waking from sleep
        mode are now filtered out if they are implausible.</li>
      <li>When the feature to announce monitored sensor readings on value
        changes has been activated, an additional tolerance value can be
        configured now to control speech output.</li>
      <li>The application detects operating system versions which are eqipped
        with defective fan control drivers. If access to fan control bears the
        potential danger a Kernel Panic is triggered due to these defects, the
        application will display a warning and will offer to disable access to
        affected sensors.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where standard sensor window and floating window
        could move a few pixels in vertical direction after the application has
        been relaunched.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where values were added to the short-term history
        diagrams in an incorrect time frame if certain values in the preference
        panel were changed.</li>
      <li>An incorrect multiplier for the display of pulse-width controlled fans
        on Power Macintosh G5 systems has been corrected.</li>
      <li>Several minor changes in the user interface. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 2.1 (Build 040804)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for new voltage and fan sensors has been added.</li>
      <li>Support for temperature sensors on the hard disk models Seagate
        ST340015A, Fujitsu MHT2080AT and Western Digital WD800JB-00FMA0 was
        added.</li>
      <li> Font types and font sizes for the sensor window and the floating
        window can now be set by the user.</li>
      <li>Horizontal and vertical layout of the sensor window can now be set
        independently of the floating window.</li>
      <li>A new function was added which tests for systems with variable clock
        frequencies.</li>
      <li>The System Info window now differentiates between nominal and actual
        clock frequencies at startup time.</li>
      <li>A new menu item was added to the Lite version which allows to launch
        the "big" version.</li>
      <li>If multiple monitors are connected in a vertical setup, the floating
        window can now be dragged to the screen "above" the menu bar.</li>
      <li>The FAQ section in the documentation has been extended.</li>
      <li> A problem was corrected which could prevent the hwmonitor command
        line program from being unlocked.</li>
      <li> The command line program tempmonitor which was missing in some
        distribution packages was added.</li>
      <li>A problem affecting the incorrect display of production data for some
        particular models manufactured for the US markets has been corrected.</li>
      <li> An incorrect multiplier for the amperage display of batteries has
        been corrected.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 2.0 (Build 040719)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The program now supports an unlimited number of sensors per computer.
        It tries to support all Macintosh systems equipped with sensors that are
        accessible by Mac OS X without needing third-party device drivers.</li>
      <li>Support for on-die temperature measurement of G5 processors has been
        added. This the first Mac OS X application with this capability that is
        distributed publicly.</li>
      <li>Support for temperature measurement of hard disks has been added. With
        this feature the application will now also support older Macintosh
        models that neither have temperature sensors on their mainboards, nor
        are capable of processor-based temperature estimates. (This feature is
        only supported with Mac OS X 10.3 or later. For technical reasons it
        cannot be offered for Jaguar.)</li>
      <li>The temperature sensors of a variety of iBook and PowerBook computers
        as well as sensors in some graphics cards are additionally supported.</li>
      <li>The program is no longer terminated when no sensor has been found. In
        this case it is still possible to read the documentation or use the
        system information feature.</li>
      <li>Rendering issues in connection with shadows not updated correctly for
        the floating window have been resolved.</li>
      <li>The application now makes sure speech output uses exactly the same
        update interval as graphical output, so there are no longer
        discrepancies between spoken and displayed values.</li>
      <li>By user request, a feature was added to optionally display temperature
        values in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit simultaneously.</li>
      <li>By user request, a feature was added to optionally zoom the
        visualization of history data into the current value range, so the
        curves are presented without losing details.</li>
      <li>By user request, the display size of readings in the Dock has been
        enlarged.</li>
      <li>By user request, readings in the Dock can optionally by displayed as
        plain text lines, enlarging the display even more.</li>
      <li>By user request, the application can be launched in a "Lite" version
        which only displays readings in the menu bar but doesn't use any space
        in the Dock.</li>
      <li>By user request, the number of digits after the decimal point is held
        constant when displaying readings. The format can now be specified for
        each sensor.</li>
      <li>By user request, a feature was added to monitor if values exceed or
        fall below definable limits and announce this by alarm messages.
        Optical, acoustical and spoken alerts are possible.</li>
      <li>The history graphs now contain an additional feature to display rulers
        that allow to exactly determine history values and their time.</li>
      <li>Long-term history data is now saved persistently when the application
        is quit. One week of readings per sensor, per computer is stored.</li>
      <li>The application supports "roaming" users in networks who use different
        computers with central private folders on a file server. In this case,
        the application stores individual sensor preferences per computer,
        allowing the user to take over configurations of similar machines.
        History data is stored per sensor, per computer, per user.</li>
      <li>The history graphs no longer show unavailable readings by horizontal
        lines. Time intervals that have not been recorded will appear as
        interruptions in the curve.</li>
      <li>The user can define an unlimited number of history windows and map
        sensors to them. An unlimited number of curves for the same type of
        physical quantity can be super-imposed in one graph.</li>
      <li>A feature to display processor type, frequencies, production date and
        production place, memory and cache sizes, as well as operating system
        version has been added.</li>
      <li>A feature to display the MPU product data of G5 processor cards has
        been added.</li>
      <li>A new window to display an overview of all sensors has been added. The
        window allows that technical detail information about each sensor
        hardware can be queried.</li>
      <li>Sensors can be identified by customized colors and names. For each of
        the different output channels, a different sensor list can be
        configured. Windows can display sensor readings in vertical or
        horizontal layout. A color legend can be displayed in a drawer of each
        history window.</li>
      <li>Windows can now be printed.</li>
      <li>Current readings or history data can be exported to text files.</li>
      <li>A feature was added allowing the software to check for newly available
        updates on the Internet.</li>
      <li>The BSD command line version of the program was revised and now
        supports an unlimited number of sensors as well.</li>
      <li>The menu was restructured.</li>
      <li>The documentation was rewritten completely.</li>
      <li>The program is now also distributed in a "pro" version under the name
        Hardware Monitor. The pro-version additionally displays battery data of
        portable computers, as well as fan, voltage, current, capacity and power
        sensors on supported computers. The pro-version is distributed as
        shareware. Temperature Monitor remains available for free.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Release 1.4 (Build 031103)</h2>
    <p>Support for temperature sensors of the next generation aluminum
      PowerBooks (Apple PowerBook G4 15-inch FW800) and support for the PowerMac
      G5 have been added. Please note that the temperature reading displayed for
      G5 models is not the CPU core temperature. See the Release Notes for
      further information.</p>
    <h2>Release 1.31 (Build 030721)</h2>
    <p>This is a maintenance update which fixes minor bugs in the user
      interface. No feature has been modified or added.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected a problem that could cause temperature degree symbols not to
        be displayed correctly if the program was launched by a user with
        non-Latin scripting systems. This affects system installations where
        Chinese, Japanese, or Korean is pre-selected as primary language.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem where temperature display was delayed after
        program launch, depending on the update interval preferred by the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><br />
      Release 1.3 (Build 030716)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for temperature sensors of aluminum PowerBooks (Apple
        PowerBook G4 12-inch and 17-inch) has been added. Thanks to Kevin
        Francis Besig for beta-testing the new release.</li>
      <li>Wording in the menu bar of the English user interface was changed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><br />
      Release 1.2 (Build 030621)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The shadow of the floating window can be switched off to improve
        readability.</li>
      <li>Documentation has been updated.</li>
      <li>The hardware survey was completed. Application development will now be
        frozen until Apple ships new hardware that makes changes necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><br />
      Release 1.1 (Build 030620)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Because a few users are under the mistaken belief it is a software
        problem when their hardware is not supported, the support status panel
        has been completely redesigned. The program now returns very detailed
        information why it is technically impossible to run the software on some
        systems.</li>
      <li>The application now supports an additional display of the temperature
        in the menu bar.</li>
      <li>It is no longer necessary to press the return key when entering a new
        update interval in the preferences panel.</li>
