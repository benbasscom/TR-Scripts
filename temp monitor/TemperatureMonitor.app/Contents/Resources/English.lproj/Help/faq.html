    <p class="sectionalheader">What is a S.M.A.R.T. hard disk sensor?</p>
    <p>S.M.A.R.T. is the abbreviation of <em>Self Monitoring, Analysis, and
        Reporting Technology .</em> It is an industry standard introduced in
      1992 to react earlier on hard disk failures. A hard disk supporting the
      S.M.A.R.T. standard monitors itself with its own micro processor and
      allows the operating system to request readouts that indicate whether
      operational parameters have changed in such a way that the hard disk might
      become defective in the near future. In this case the hard disk can be
      replaced before any data is lost.</p>
    <p>Some hard disk manufacturers allow the computer to request additional
      detail information, e.g. the current operating temperature of the disk.
      However, this feature is not an official part of the S.M.A.R.T. standards.
      Not every disk supporting S.M.A.R.T. is capable of providing temperature
      readings. Either the data is not measured at all, or the hard disk
      manufacturer did not publish how the data can be read out from the disk
      controller.</p>
    <p>Temperature Monitor and Hardware Monitor analyze all hard disks connected
      to your computer if they include accessible temperature sensors. Each disk
      is tested for compliance with the S.M.A.R.T. standard. If the disk is
      supporting S.M.A.R.T. and the procedure for reading the temperature value
      of this particular model is known, the readings are automatically acquired
      by the software.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">Why is no temperature displayed for my external
      FireWire or USB hard disk?</p>
    <p>Nearly all FireWire or USB hard disks are in fact ATA hard disks accessed
      via a "FireWire/USB to ATA bridge device". Those bridge chips only
      translate a subset of the ATA commands between the FireWire/USB and the
      ATA protocol standards. In particular, commands to transfer S.M.A.R.T.
      diagnostic data (which are needed to access the temperature sensors inside
      the drives) are usually not supported. For this reason it is technically
      impossible to transport temperature data across a bridge. There will be a
      future industry standard called "Smart Command Transfer (SCT)" which will
      address this issue. But it will take some time before Apple and the hard
      disk vendors can fully support this.</p>
    <p>Use the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show Drive Overview</cite> or Press
      <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd> to
      display the transport protocols of all disk drives and their S.M.A.R.T.
      capabilities.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">Why is no temperature displayed for my solid
      state drive (SSD)?</p>
    <p>Not all drives compliant with the S.M.A.R.T. standard are providing
      temperature values. Different from conventional hard disks, the ambient
      temperature is not an important factor to estimate the remaining lifetime
      of an SSD. For this reason, many SSDs don't have any temperature sensors.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">My computer can display the CPU temperature using
      a program running on Mac OS 9, or using a special software for an upgrade
      CPU card with Mac OS X, but the monitor application does not find any
      sensors. It this an error?</p>
    <p>This can only happen for computer models that either are using very old
      processor models which estimated their internal temperature via an
      inaccurate Thermal Assist Unit (TAU) but not a real temperatur sensor, or
      for computer models having a processor card of a third-party manufacturer
      which uses its own drivers.</p>
    <p>If you are using a third-party processor card and temperature values can
      be displayed by special software, the manufacturer of this card has to
      publish a driver which is compatible with Mac OS X and makes temperature
      readings publicly available. After that, the sensor will be automatically
      detected by the application and values can be displayed. Card
      manufacturers can contact us for receiving more technical information.</p>
    <p>Note that we cannot support upgrade processor cards from manufacturers
      that do not disclose technical detail information about their products.
      Some companies want to sell their own temperature monitor software and
      make sure their sensors cannot be accessed openly.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">I am running the program on an x86-based computer
      which has not been manufactured by Apple. Only sensors for hard drives,
      batteries, and Intel CPU monitoring are displayed, but no other values.
      Can you add support for the other sensors of my mainboard?</p>
    <p>This is only possible if the manufacturer of your system or your
      mainboard develops a driver for the sensors that is compatible with Mac OS
      X. Manufacturers can contact us for receiving more technical information</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">The sensor X shows the reading Y. Is this normal?</p>
    <p>If you want to find out whether a sensor value is within normal limits,
      please select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show Overview </cite>(or
      press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>) and look for the limits in the third and
      fourth columns of the sensor table. They contain the known official limits
      Apple has specified for readings acquired at the given sensor locations.
      If no limit is given in the table, this either means that it does not make
      sense to specify a limit for this particular sensor (e.g. the battery
      capacity should not have limits), or Apple hasn't published any
      specifications for this sensor. </p>
    <p>Note that all up-to-date Macintosh models automatically shut down or
      enter sleep mode if one of the readings exceeds a critical limit. For this
      reason it is impossible that your computer can be damaged in an
      overtemperature condition.</p>
    <p>For old computers without temperature managment, no limits have been
      specified by Apple. In this case use the following limits as orientation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most older G3 or G4 processors are designed for a maximum operating
        temperature of 105 degrees Celsius (221 degrees Fahrenheit), measured at
        the chip die of the CPU. </li>
      <li>G4 processors of type 7455 or later (typically used in Macintosh
        systems with 867 MHz and above) are designed for a maximum operating
        temperature of 65 degrees Celsius (149 degrees Fahrenheit), also
        measured at the chip die of the CPU.</li>
      <li>Most desktop hard drives are specified for a maximum operating
        temperature of 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). For exact
        information, use the <cite>Drive Overview</cite> window (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd>)
        to get the manufacturer and model code of your hard drive, and then
        direct your web browser to the manufacturer's web site to download the
        official data sheet for this drive. The temperature limits are always
        specified. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="sectionalheader">Why is my hard disk not put into sleep mode if
      the application is running?</p>
    <p>If one or more hard disks are equipped with temperature sensors, the
      values will be read out in regular intervals. Mac OS X is interpreting
      this as access to the hard disk which causes the disk not to be put into
      sleep mode.</p>
    <p>You can change this behavior by enabling the disk saver feature of the
      application: When you are inactive and the computer is not really in use
      for some period of time, the program can automatically stop all sensor
      communication with your hard drive(s). This allows the standard sleep
      feature of the hard drives to become active. Just open the preferences
      window, go to the <cite>General</cite> pane and set the pop-up menu of
      the option <cite>Disk Saver</cite> to the desired time-interval for user
      inactivity. </p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">Why is only one temperature value displayed for
      my dual G4 computer? It has two CPUs.</p>
    <p>The temperature value is not measured by the processor
      itself but by an external sensor. For the "Power Mac G4 (Mirrored
      Drive-Doors)" this
      sensor is located at the center of the processor board. Only one sensor is
      available
      even if there are two processors on the card.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">Why are two hard drive temperature sensors
      displayed for my iMac G5? It has only one hard drive!</p>
    <p>The iMac G5 may have two temperature sensors for the hard drive
      (depending on the drive model) although it contains one hard disk only.
      The sensor labeled as <cite>S.M.A.R.T. hard disk sensor</cite> is the
      internal temperature sensor provided by the hard drive vendor. The sensor
      labeled <cite>Hard Drive</cite> is the sensor provided by Apple. Apple's
      sensor is mounted at the outer metal frame of the drive carrier unit and
      measures the temperature of the air flow produced by the drive cooling
      fan. The S.M.A.R.T. sensor is located inside the drive unit, so its
      temperature is usually some degrees higher.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">Why do the power sensors of the Power Mac G5
      slots not carry a unit?</p>
    <p>At this time we don't have enough data about these sensors. For this
      reason it is unknown in which unit the readings have to be interpreted.
      The readings could, for example, be interpreted as milliwatts. The sensors
      <cite>Slot 12V, Slot 3.3V</cite> and <cite>Slot 5V</cite> show the power
      load drawn by PCI cards for the respective voltages. The sensor <cite>Slot
        combined</cite> also includes the current power load by the SATA hard
      disks.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">Why do the readings for the temperature sensors
      "Processor Card x Ambient" found in some PowerMac G5 systems never change?</p>
    <p>Mac OS X does not seem to refresh these sensors on a regular basis. The
      system also ignores explicit commands to get new readings from these
      sensors. It is necessary to restart the computer or to put it to sleep
      mode temporarily to get up-to-date values.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">The application displays a warning that I am
      using an Intel CPU with out-of-date microcode and that the per-core
      temperature sensors may stop working after the system is waking from sleep
      mode. What should I do?</p>
    <p>This problem is caused by an internal design flaw affecting the first
      generation of Intel Core processors. The Digital Thermal Sensors may stop
      working when the processor returns from a C3/C4 power saving state. Intel
      has corrected
      this hardware bug in later versions of the CPU.</p>
    <p>As a workaround, you should install Apple's firmware updates for your
      particular Intel-based Macintosh model. <strong>This will fix the problem
        in most, but not all cases.</strong> It is recommended to install the
      firmware update for the Boot-ROM, as well as the firmware update for the
      System Management Controller (SMC). To download the firmware updates from
      Apple, please see the following table:</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Macintosh systems built after September 2006 are
      no longer affected by the aforementioned problem. </p>
    <p>Intel refers to this hardware problem as <strong>Erratum AE18</strong>.
      For detailed information, please see <a href="http://www.intel.com/design/mobile/specupdt/309222.htm">Intel
        document 30922204.</a></p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">What does it mean if the reading for an internal
      temperature sensor of an Intel processor is being displayed as "---"?</p>
    <p>This indicates that the application has no longer received up-to-date
      values from this sensor for a certain amount of time. This is normal if
      you have switched off the respective CPU core. Under specific
      circumstances, this can also happen if the system is under very low or
      very high CPU load. Note that Intel recommends a default access interval
      of 82 seconds to read out and use data of thermal processor sensors, so
      continuous monitoring of these sensors is not really critical.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">When using an up-to-date Intel Core i series
      processor, many of the internal core sensors of the processor show "---"
      readings only. Is this normal?</p>
    <p>Yes, this is the correct and intended behavior of Core i series
      processors, depending on current system load. Mac OS X fully supports the
      energy saver technologies offered by these CPUs. If your computer is not
      under full load, all unused processor cores will be powered off, so their
      internal sensors are shut down, too. The cores will automatically wake up
      again when more jobs have to be executed. If you have a system with 2
      processor packages, with 8-cores and 16 logical processors in total (see
      the section on Intel Hyperthreading further below), you will see the
      following behavior, for example:</p>

    <p class="sectionalheader">Some other monitoring applications always show
      temperature values for all available cores on my Core i processor. Isn't
      this a better behavior?</p>
    <p>No, this is in fact a serious design flaw in those programs. They either
      don't track correctly which cores are sleeping, or -even worse- they force
      all cores to keep awake in order to get updated readings continuously. The
      latter will significantly change the normal behavior of the CPU, creating
      very different readings for temperature, voltages, currents, and power.
      Influencing the monitored object is the worst thing a monitor program can
      do.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">When running certain applications on my Core i
      processor, I sometimes see a sudden increase of temperature, amperage and
      power values. The readings remain at a high level until I shut such an
      application down. Is there something wrong with my system?</p>
    <p>No, what you see is an intended feature of certain Core i processors
      which is called "Intel Turbo Boost Technology". If the processor detects
      that most of its cores are sleeping because total load on the system is
      low, but there is one continuously working program which is not
      multi-threaded, so it mainly works on one core only, the processor will
      automatically accelerate itself by increasing its clock frequency, a
      procedure known as "overclocking".</p>
    <p>Overclocking means that the CPU will run at a "higher than normal" clock
      frequency. For example, if you have a system with a nominal clockspeed of
      2.66 GHz, the processor may accelerate to clockspeeds of up to 3.06 GHz.
      Acceleration is done by the processor itself. The operating system can
      neither influence nor control this, it only needs to enable the standard
      energy saver features of the processor. Operating the processor beyond its
      normal clock specifications is possible in this particular situation,
      because only one core is active while the others are powered down, so
      there is a large remaining safety headroom which can be exploited by the
      single core. For example, when only one core in a 4-core processor is
      active, it can safely consume more power and generate more heat than
      normal because the single core can "steal" the safety headroom normally
      reserved for operating the other 3 cores.</p>
    <p>Turbo Boost ensures that the processor can assess its own headroom. The
      processor monitors its own temperature, the drawn current, and its power
      consumption. Increasing the clock frequency stops automatically as soon as
      either the temperature is some degrees below the allowed maximum limit,
      electrical specifications are some percentage below their permitted
      maxima, or the highest possible overclock frequency has been reached. Of
      course, Turbo Boost will also stop as soon as the other cores are waking
      from sleep state, i.e. when total system load becomes higher. This can
      result in the unusual consequence that the temperature of the processor
      may decrease when total CPU load increases.</p>
    <p>It is not uncommon for the core temperature to rise by more than 30
      centigrades, or the drawn current to rise by more than 8 Amperes within a
      few seconds, as soon as Turbo Boost becomes active. The actual effects and
      the applications triggering Turbo Boost may vary between operating system
      versions, because Apple is silently optimizing the energy saver and
      scheduling features during certain OS updates. Due to the nature of Turbo
      Boost, process scheduling and energy saver policies have an indirect
      effect on the times when the processor can safely exploit Turbo Boost.</p>

    <p class="sectionalheader">Why are the temperature values for some of my
      FB-DIM modules in the Mac Pro or Xserve missing while others are displayed
      fine?</p>
    <p>This indicates that you are using FB-DIMMs which are not fully compatible
      with Macintosh systems. In most cases this is caused by errors in the
      firmware of the AMB chip (Advanced Memory Buffer) controlling the module.
      <strong>You should replace these incompatible modules: If your system is
        not receiving valid temperature readings from the FB-DIMMs, the cooling
        control for the RAM temperature zone won't work correctly.</strong></p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">I get readings of more than 90°C (194°F) for the
      FB-DIM modules in my Mac Pro. Isn't this a bit high?</p>
    <p>No, temperatures in that range are normal for FB-DIMMs and are no cause
      for concern. Each FB-DIMM contains its own controller, called "Advanced
      Memory Buffer (AMB)". An AMB also contains an internal sensor which
      measures temperature directly inside the chip. The specified maximum
      temperature<br />
      range of an FB-DIMM, measured by the AMB, usually lies in the interval
      between 95°C and 125°C (203°F .. 257°F). It will vary from manufacturer to
      manufacturer, a typical value is 110°C (230°F). If you like to know the
      exact specifications for your FB-DIM modules, note the part number and
      manufacturer of the respective modules (printed on the label of each
      module), and download the data sheets for those parts from the
      manufacturer. Nearly all chip manufacturers and RAM vendors publish the
      specifications at their web sites.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">I am using an Intel-based system of a model
      series which was announced after January 2008. Temperature Monitor can
      display the external CPU temperature but not the temperature values per
      core, even if I install the driver for extended x86 sensor support.
      Hardware Monitor displays "Core Hot" status sensors in that case. Does
      this indicate a problem?</p>
    <p>No, this is the correct and intended behavior for some specific Intel
      processors. When Intel introduced the third generation of Core and
      Core-based Xeon processors, manufactured in 45 nm technology ("Penryn"
      series), they also changed specific aspects how the Digital Thermal
      Sensors (DTS) on the chip cores are working. To check if your system is
      using a third generation Core processor, open the <cite>System Info</cite>
      window in the application and press the button <cite>More info…</cite>
      inside the window. A processor of this series will be identified as <cite>x86
        Family: 6</cite>, <cite>x86 Model: 23</cite>.</p>
    <p>If a processor of this series additionally identifies as being <cite>Xeon(R)</cite>,
      it won't be possible to get an accurate per-core temperature reading.
      Those processors are equipped with Digital Thermal Sensors which do not
      work linear enough under normal operating conditions. They will only show
      accurate readings near the maximum allowed temperature limit. For this
      reason, Temperature Monitor won't display core temperature readings in
      that case, Hardware Monitor will display a "Hot" status information only.</p>
    <p>If a processor of this series identifies as being a <cite>Core(TM) 2 Duo</cite>,
      it will depend on the exact CPU model. For the processor types in use by
      Apple, the applications should be capable of displaying core temperature
      readings. If you are using a CPU usually not found in Apple computers, the
      applications might not always be capable of displaying core readings.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">When using an Intel Core 2 Duo processor of
      family 6 model 23 (see previous question) the temperature readings from
      the core sensors sometimes appear to be lower than the outer CPU
      temperature. Isn't this wrong?</p>
    <p>This is the way the Digital Thermal Sensors and the temperature diode
      sensors are designed. The effect is caused by different policies used for
      the calibration of the sensors. The two types of sensors have different
      accuracies and are factory-calibrated to different maximum points. For
      this reason, the DTS reading cannot be used to predict the CPU case
      reading.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">How should I interpret the output of the sensors
      named "CPU Core x Hot"?</p>
    <p>On low core temperatures, the sensors will give a reading of 0. When the
      core temperature exceeds a value of 10 Kelvins below the maximum allowed
      temperature limit, the value will switch to 1, indicating that the core is
      hot. This tries to match the behavior of Apple's cooling system which
      usually attempts to hold the temperature of Intel CPUs in the range
      between 20 and 10 Kelvins below the maximum point when the processor is
      stressed under full operating load. This means, a hot status does <strong>not</strong>
      indicate that the CPU has reached an overtemperature condition yet, it may
      still be 10 Kelvins below it. In fact, many users consider this
      temperature range to be the "best" operating condition, because it
      indicates that the CPU has reached its maximum Thermal Design Power and is
      operating with full performance.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">The application displays readings for twice as
      much processor cores as should actually be in my Mac. Is this correct?</p>
    <p>Yes, this behavior is correct for processors with Intel® Core™ i
      technology. By default, Mac OS X will enable a hardware feature called
      "Simultaneous Multi-Threading" when detecting these CPUs. Intel calls this
      "Hyperthreading Technology". Simultaneous Multi-Threading means that a
      single processor can dispatch two independent streams of instructions at
      the same time, so one physical processor can act as two processors. Mac OS
      X and all applications will behave as if twice as much processors are
      built into the computer. To display the true number of physical and
      virtual processors, select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show System
        Info</cite>, or press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>. The line <cite>Number
        of processors</cite> will display how many physical and how many logical
      processors are available, and how many processors are currently actively
      in use by Mac OS X. The number of processor chips can be displayed by
      pressing the button <cite>More info…</cite> next to this line. By using
      the navigation buttons in the upper right corner of the processor details
      sheet, you can browse through all chips available. The program will
      display each chip with the title <cite>Unit x</cite>, where <cite>x</cite>
      is the current number of the chip package. Example: 8 processor cores, 16
      logical processors, 16 actively in use, in 2 chips.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">The System Information window shows a bus speed
      of only 100 MHz. Isn't this wrong for my new Mac with Intel Core i
      processor?</p>
    <p>No. The value of 100 MHz is a symbolic fallback value Mac OS X uses for
      specific Macintosh models which no longer have a conventional system bus
      or front side bus. The memory controller has become part of the processor
      and no longer needs an external bus. The link to I/O devices is now
      handled by the <em>Direct Media Interface (DMI)</em>.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">I am using a third-party tool to enable the SLFM
      feature of my Intel processor. However, the frequency change is not
      reflected by the frequency sensor display of Hardware Monitor. Does this
      indicate a problem?</p>
    <p>No. Hardware Monitor currently doesn't support monitoring the SLFM status
      (Super Low Frequency Mode) of Intel processors. This would require
      accessing undocumented parts of the processor. For safety reasons, it is
      the application's policy not to use such techniques. If you have modified
      your system to use SLFM within Mac OS X, the frequency reading shown by
      Hardware Monitor can sometimes be off by a factor of 2.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">Why do some PowerMac G5 systems with 4 CPU cores
      sometimes not display values for their second cooling pump? </p>
    <p>Apple distributes two different versions of the "quad" PowerMac G5
      computers: Some of them are equipped with two pumps for the liquid cooling
      system, while others contain a revised version of the cooling system with
      only one pump. Hardware Monitor correctly reflects the situation for each
      version. If the sensor for the second pump is missing (label "CPU B
      Radiator Pump"), your computer uses a liquid cooling system with one pump
      only.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">I have disconnected a fan cable or completely
      removed a fan in my Mac. Hardware Monitor still displays changing sensor
      values for this fan however. How is this possible?</p>
    <p>Depending on the hardware model you are using and on the version of Mac
      OS X currently running, the operating system may not allow than an
      application program (like Hardware Monitor) gets access to the <em>input</em>
      values sent by the fan sensors. To get a reading nevertheless, Hardware
      Monitor then tries to get the <em>output</em> values the cooling control
      system sends to the fans.</p>
    <p>Under normal circumstances, there is no difference between the input and
      the output values: If a fan is present, it will automatically follow the
      output value within a few milliseconds. However, when you remove the fan
      or the sensor, you are getting a "ghost" reading.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">I am using a portable Mac of a model series
      announced after October 2008. Sometimes, the set of displayed GPU sensors
      appears to be changing. Many of the sensors for the graphics chips are,
      for example, displayed as being "disconnected" when I display their
      preferences in the Sensor section of the Preferences window. How is this
      possible?</p>
    <p>In this case, you must be using a Mac capable of switching between two
      alternative graphics solutions, for example a pair of an <strong>Nvidia
        GeForce 9400M</strong> and a <strong>GeForce 9600M GT</strong>, or <strong>Intel
        HD Graphics</strong> paired with an <strong>Nvidia GeForce GT 330M</strong>.
      It is the correct and expected behavior to only show the sensors which are
      currently online. The sensors of the GPU which is currently offline are
      powered down and even cannot be detected. If you find an option for <cite>Graphics</cite>
      in the <cite>Energy Saver</cite> section of <cite>System Preferences</cite>,
      your Mac will support this kind of switching.</p>
    <p>In some cases, your Mac might be in an aggressive power saving mode when
      starting the application, with the effect that the application <strong>may
        see both GPUs as being inactive</strong>. In this situation, the
      readings of all graphics processor sensors -with exception of the outer
      chip and heat sink sensors- will be suppressed.</p>
    <p>If you have upgraded to Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, you may also see the
      "disconnected" state. Apple has removed support for GPU load measuring
      from many of the graphics drivers of Lion. You should erase the display
      preferences for the GPU load sensor in this case.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">How can I check if Hardware Monitor would detect
      more sensors for my computer than Temperature Monitor?</p>
    <p>Simply start the Hardware Monitor application. The sensors detected

    <p class="sectionalheader">How many registration keys do I have to purchase

    <p>Registration keys for Hardware Monitor and Hardware Monitor Remote are

      a second key because then we'll have a network of two monitored computers
      which are in use at the same time. </p>
    <p>Another example: You have 2 computers that should be capable of
      monitoring each other. In this case you install the applications 4 times
      (a copy of Hardware Monitor and a copy of Hardware Monitor Remote on both
      systems), but you only need to buy 2 registration keys.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">How can I configure Hardware Monitor to
      automatically warn me when a disk in a RAID set is failing, or a drive is
      no longer passing its S.M.A.R.T. self test?</p>
    <p>This can be done in two simple steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the pane <cite>Probes</cite> in the <cite>Preferences</cite>
        window of Hardware Monitor and create a RAID or SMART probe for the
        drive in question.</li>
      <li>Go to the pane <cite>Alerts</cite>, use the <cite>+</cite> button
        next to the table of sensors to be monitored and drag the newly created
        probe entry from the drawer into the table. Make sure the entry is still
        selected, remove the checkmark at <cite>Trigger alarm: When value
          exceeds threshold of</cite>, and set a checkmark at <cite>Trigger
          alarm: When value falls below</cite>, entering a value of <cite>1</cite>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can then select which of the possible alert actions should be taken.
      If you want to continuously monitor the drive, it is recommended to add
      Hardware Monitor to your list of login items.</p>
    <p class="sectionalheader">I have removed the application from an
      Intel-based system but have forgotten to use its function to deinstall the
      driver for access to the internal processor sensors beforehand. Can I
      remove this driver manually?</p>
    <p>Yes, this is possible. Make sure you are working as user with
      administrative permission and remove the folder</p>
    <p><code>/Library/StartupItems/BRESINKx86Monitoring</code></p>
    <p>at the highest level of your system volume. The driver will become
      inactive the next time you start the operating system. </p>
