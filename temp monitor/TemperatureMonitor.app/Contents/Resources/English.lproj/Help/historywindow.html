<p>The monitor application contains a powerful history feature that allows to track the development of readings for an extended period of time and to visualize the data graphically. History data can be displayed in two different modes of operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><cite>Short-term history:</cite> the previous 380 readings per sensor are displayed. The affected time period depends on the currently defined <a href="prefs.html">update interval</a>. Short-term values are lost when  the application is quit.</li>
  <li><cite>Long-term history</cite>: a period of one week maximum per sensor is displayed. One reading is stored each minute while the application is running. The values are kept persistently and are not lost if the application is quit. In a network with &quot;roaming&quot; users, storage is organized per user, per computer. Readings can be visualized graphically, selecting a variable time range between 1 hour and 7 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>The readings can be displayed in one or an unlimited number of windows as in the following example.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/History.png" alt="History Example" width="480" height="502" /></p>
<p align="left" class="infocell">A curve is displayed with an interruption if
  no values have been recorded in the affected time range. The monitor
  program was not running or the computer was switched off. </p>
<p align="left">Using the buttons in the lower left corner, you can choose between
  the two history modes. If the long-term history is selected, you can set the
  desired time interval with the slider. Time is visualized from left to right
  with the current readings display at the right border.</p>
<p align="left">When the selected time interval is so large that it can no longer
  be displayed with full resolution in the current window width, the application
  allows you to scroll horizontally over the entire set of values. A magnifying
  glass with a <cite>-</cite> symbol will appear in this case (see below). If
  you click on this icon, the history will zoom out the time axis so that it
  fits completely into the window, and the symbol will turn into a <cite>+</cite> sign.
  Note that isolated areas of the scaled down curves (in case of major gaps in
  the history data) may become so small that they are no longer visible. To
  return to full resolution again, press the <cite>+</cite> symbol. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/HistoryZoom.png" alt="Zooming the time axis" width="416" height="47" /> </p>
<p align="left">When the checkmark <cite>Colors/Extreme Values</cite> is set,
   a drawer opens at the side of the window, displaying a legend which sensor
  is marked by which color. The table in the drawer also displays the extreme
  values of the sensors for the selected time interval, which is explained
  in detail <a href="extreme.html">in a different section</a> of the reference
  manual.  Color
  settings can be modified right here, by clicking onto one of the colors in
  the table, or via the <a href="output.html">preferences
  window</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Setting the checkmark <cite> Rulers</cite> will bring up two
    rulers that act as a crosshair. It can be used to determine the exact values
    of each curve point. The values for time and reading are shown next to the
    crosshair center.</p>
<p align="left">The switch <cite>Curve Labels</cite> allows to show a small identification
  label next to each curve. The labels will use the short sensor names you have
  defined in the <a href="output.html">preferences window</a>. </p>
<p align="left">To open all configured history windows select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show
    History Windows</cite> or press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>.
    You can also use this item if you have closed several (but not necessarily
    all) history windows and want to make sure that all are reopened. To close
    all history windows at the same time, select <cite>Window &gt; Hide History
    Windows</cite> or press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>.</p>
<p align="left">You can define an arbitrary number of history windows. The number is only limited by the memory size of your computer. History windows and the individual sensors that should be displayed in them can be configured with the <cite>History</cite> pane in the preferences window.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/PrefHistory.png" alt="History" width="620" height="538" /></p>
<p align="left">To create a new history window, press the button <cite>+</cite> left to the upper table. A new table entry will be displayed, and after clicking it you can change the title of the new window as desired. To delete one or multiple windows, select the respective entries in the table and press the button labeled <cite>-</cite>.</p>
<p align="left">If a window is selected, you can add or remove sensors in the
  lower half of the window in the same way <a href="output.html">discussed earlier</a>.
  Note that a single history window can only contain sensors of the same quantity
  type. Otherwise, it would not be possible to label the vertical axis in a clean
  way. This means it is not possible to have a temperature sensor and a battery
  capacity sensor in the same history window. The background color for each window
  can be set with the small color well above the sensor table. </p>
<p align="left" class="infocell">It is no problem to display a single sensor
  in multiple history windows simultaneously. However, you should avoid creating
  too many history windows on systems without enough computing power. The continuous
  updates necessary for all graphs may waste computation time which will no longer
  be available to other applications.</p>
<h2 align="left">Combining history windows</h2>
<p align="left">A single history window can only contain sensors of the same
  quantity type, for example temperature sensors only. This is necessary to make
  sure the graphs are showing consistent scales and units on their vertical axes.
  In some cases however, you might want to observe how sensors of different types
  interacted at a certain point in time. For example, a high processor load causing
  higher CPU temperatures and higher amperage, causing higher fan speeds.</p>
<p align="left">To monitor a  time interval, putting sensors with
  different quantities into direct relation with each other, you can combine
  several  windows, overlaying their history graphs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the history windows which should become part of the combined
      window.</li>
  <li>Select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Combine History Windows&hellip;</cite>.
      An inspector panel will open. </li>
  <li>Click on the history window which should become the main window
      of the combination. The combined history window will have the currently
    selected time interval, scale and unit of that main window.</li>
  <li>In the inspector panel, set checkmarks in the column <cite>Overlay</cite> for
      each history window which should be combined with the selected main window.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">You can remove all overlays from the selected main window by
  pressing the button <cite>Deactive Overlays</cite> in the inspector panel.
  Note that the following restrictions apply to combined history windows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The sensors of overlaid windows will not appear in the color
      overview or extreme value drawers of the main window.</li>
  <li>You cannot combine windows which are already part of another
      combination.</li>
  <li>The labels of the y-axes of all overlaid graphs will disappear.
      The main window will display a warning that the display shows curves with
    different units and scales. </li>
</ul>
<h2 align="left">Saving history values</h2>
<p align="left">The history values are automatically saved by the application
  each time it is quit. However, if your computer is defective and you are using
  the application to verify if the defect is caused by an over-temperature condition,
  the history readouts may be lost when the computer crashes before the data
  could be saved. For this reason you can enable the option to automatically
  save the data in regular intervals. Set a checkmark at <cite>Automatically
  save history data every x minutes</cite> and enter a value between 1 and 1440
  minutes (one day). The setting is effective for this computer only, not for
  remotely monitored computers. </p>
<h2 align="left">Erasing history values</h2>
<p align="left">You can clear all values for the short-term history of all sensors by selecting the menu item <cite>Monitor &gt; Clear Short-Term History</cite> or pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>. </p>
<p align="left">If it happens to be necessary to delete stored values of the long-term history, drag the folder</p>
<p align="left"><code>~/Library/Application Support/Hardware Monitor</code>, or</p>
<p align="left"><code>~/Library/Application Support/Temperature Monitor </code>respectively,</p>
<p align="left">from your private folder to the trash. Note that this will erase all readings for all computers you have used in the past!</p>
<p align="left" class="infocell">The short-time history is cleared automatically when the update interval for readings is changed.</p>
