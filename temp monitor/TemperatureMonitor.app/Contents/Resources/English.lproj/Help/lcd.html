<p>There can be situations where it's not sufficient to monitor your system via
  an attached screen or remotely via the network. It can make sense to have
  monitoring capabilities directly at the computer's enclosure, especially if
  the system is not equipped with a screen. Servers running in a &quot;headless&quot; configuration,
  e.g. Xserve units which usually don't even have a graphics card, are a good
  example.</p>
<p>For this type of configuration, Hardware Monitor can send readings to an external
  alphanumeric liquid crystal display (LCD) which can be connected to the computer
  via USB interface. An example is shown in the following photo:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/LCDisplay.jpg" alt="LCD output example" width="200" height="72" /> </p>
<p>In addition to acquired readings from sensors and probes, Hardware Monitor
  allows you to specify additional data for output as well, for example the current
  time, or the IP address of a certain network interface. The example
  above shows date and time, four temperature values, a CPU load bar-graph, three
  S.M.A.R.T. status values, one RAID status value, and a selected IP address.
  The contents of the display is updated at the same rate as all other output
  channels of Hardware Monitor. The mentioned features are not available in Temperature
  Monitor. </p>
<p>Hardware Monitor supports the following hardware equipment <em>only</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alphanumeric liquid crystal display modules, following the original <strong>Hitachi
      HD44780</strong> industry
      standard. The LCD <em>must</em> be connected via an USB controller of the
      type <strong>&quot;IO-Warrior 24&quot;</strong>,
    a product developed by <strong>Code Mercenaries Hard- und Software
    GmbH</strong>.</li>
  <li>Alphanumeric liquid crystal display modules with USB interfaces, manufactured
    by <strong>Crystalfontz America Inc</strong>. Modules of the series <strong>CF-632</strong> (16
    x 2 characters) and <strong>CF-634</strong> (20 x 4 characters) are
    supported.</li>
  <li>Graphical liquid crystal displays as part of products made by <cite>Logitech</cite>,
    for example
    <cite>G15</cite> or <cite>G19 G-series keyboards</cite>, or <cite>Z-series
    speakers</cite>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Crystalfontz displays are in fact serial (RS-232) modules which come with
  an on-board USB-to-serial converter. You will need an additional device driver
  for your version of Mac OS X to allow the operating system to connect to this
  converter. The converter is made by <strong>Future Technology Devices International
  Limited (FTDI). </strong>Free drivers
  from FTDI are available at this web page: <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm</a>.
  No additional software is required for the IO-Warrior solution. </p>

<h2>Preparing a Crystalfontz module</h2>
<p>In order to use a Crystalfontz USB module, you'll have to execute the following
  steps first:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the necessary Virtual COM port driver for your version of Mac OS
    X from <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">FTDI</a>. Unpack
    and install the driver.</li>
  <li>Connect the display module to a USB port.</li>
  <li>Make sure the USB-to-serial converter is detected by Mac OS X. Open <cite>System
      Preferences</cite> and go to <cite>Network</cite>. You should receive a
      message that a new serial device has been detected. Verify if the settings
      are correct. You should not enable networking features on the communication
      line to the module.</li>
</ol>
<p class="infocell"><strong>WARNING:</strong> We have no influence on the quality
  of third-party drivers. The FTDI driver may cause Kernel Panics in Mac OS X,
  especially on systems with more than 2 GB of main memory. Kernel Panics
  will crash the operating system, causing data loss. If you have problems with
  the driver, please make sure you are using the latest available version, or
  contact the manufacturers for assistance.</p>
<p class="infocell"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Neither the FTDI USB converter,
  nor the Crystalfontz module provide a valid serial number for the LCD unit
  to Mac OS X. For this reason, neither Mac OS X, nor Hardware Monitor can correctly
  track the module if you disconnect and then reconnect it to your system. Mac
  OS X may mistakenly identify a re-attached module as a <strong>new</strong> device
  which must be configured once more. This means all preference settings for
  the LCD module in System Preferences and in Hardware Monitor have to be set
  again.</p>
<h2>Preparing a Logitech LCD product</h2>
<p>Logitech does not allow that Hardware Monitor can control the LC display on
  their products directly. This is necessary, because the display can be used
  by several applications of different vendors simultaneously, so access to the
  display must be coordinated. The software <cite>Logitech LCD Manager version
  3</cite> must be installed before Hardware Monitor can detect and work with
  displays on Logitech products. This software is either shipped with the product,
  or can be downloaded for free from the website of Logitech. Please see the
  documentation that comes with the product for further information.</p>
<p>Hardware Monitor is supporting Logitech LCD products with either monochrome
  or color displays. If multiple devices are connected at the same time, Hardware
  Monitor will show the same display contents on all Logitech displays. You can
  use the <cite>LCD Manager</cite> pane in System Preferences to deselect particular displays
  from being used by Hardware Monitor. When using a color display, the output
  of Hardware Monitor will use the color white only. Only the display itself
  is supported, additional buttons which might be available on certain devices
  are ignored by the application.</p>
<p>Logitech does not support that applications can track different LCD products
  individually. For this reason, Hardware Monitor will only show one single entry
  named <cite>Logitech LCD Manager</cite> in its list of detected USB devices, even if multiple
  Logitech LCD products are connected. The serial number displayed by Hardware
  Monitor is always <cite>00000000</cite>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is recommended to select the display type   <cite>3 x 25 characters</cite> if
    you are using a monochrome Logitech display.</li>
  <li>It is recommended to select the display type <cite>17 x 52 characters</cite> if
    you are using a Logitech display supporting color.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing the font or font size is currently not supported.</p>
<h2>Configuring  display units</h2>
<p>Configuration of an external LCD unit is very easy and can be done by simple
drag-and-drop operations.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Connect one or more external LCD units to the USB interface of your computer.</li>
  <li>Launch Hardware Monitor, open the <cite>Preferences</cite> window and go to the section
      <cite>LCD Module</cite>.</li>
  <li>All detected USB units will be displayed in the small table at the top
    of the window. To select which type of LC display is connected to each USB
    unit, click on a line in the table, then use the pop-up menu <cite>Configure
    selected USB device for display type</cite> to choose how many lines and
    columns are available on the display. The button <cite>Run Test&hellip;</cite> can
    be used to send a test pattern to the selected LCD.</li>
</ol>
<p>The LC Display will light up as soon as you switch the type menu from <cite>No
  display </cite>to one of the possible display types. The following test patterns are
  available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>text output which identifies chip type and serial number of the USB unit.
      This makes it easier to see which module is which when you are working
    with more than one device.</li>
  <li>text output with line and column numbers. This test allows you to verify
    if the display type setting is correct.</li>
  <li>a table of Latin characters.</li>
  <li> a table of Japanese Katakana characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the selected LCD module is capable of controlling additional settings via
  software, the button <cite>LCD Settings</cite> will become active. After pressing it, a
  dialog sheet will open and you can set operating parameters as backlight brightness
  or display contrast.</p>
<p>You can additionally activate a &quot;backlight saver&quot; for each of your LCD modules
  which makes sure that the display will be switched off after your computer
  has not been in use for a specified time. Just select the desired time (or
  the value <cite>never</cite>) with the slider at <cite>Start backlight saver</cite>.
  It's a good idea to select the same time interval you have set for your screen
  saver in System Preferences but this is not necessarily required.</p>
<p class="infocell">The IO-Warrior USB controller does not need any drivers to
  be accessible by Mac OS X. To make this technically possible, it has to act
  like a Human Interface Device (HID), similar to a mouse or keyboard. For this
  reason, Mac OS X will interpret certain signals of the IO-Warrior device as
  &quot;user interaction&quot;, causing your system to no longer enter any sleep modes
  when the module is active.
  <strong>If you want to use automatic sleep mode for your screen
  or your computer, you'll have to enable the backlight saver for the IO-Warrior
  module.</strong> In this case,
  communication to the LCD module will stop after the selected time interval.
  At that moment, Mac OS X will no longer misinterpret the module as active user,
  and the standard sleep intervals will begin as expected. Note that the total
  sleep timeout interval will be the sum of the LCD backlight saver time and
  the sleep time you have configured in the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/PrefLCD.png" alt="Hardware Monitor Preferences: LCD Module" width="620" height="538" /> </p>
<p align="left">After the display type has been configured, you can use the lower
  part of the window to select which output elements should be sent to the display.
  The left table shows you all output elements which are available on the local
  computer. The right table shows you the active elements which are currently
  being sent to the display. At the beginning, the right-hand table is empty.
  You can use the mouse, dragging elements from the left to the right table to
  configure the desired output step by step.</p>
<p align="left">The selected output elements will appear immediately on the display,
  showing the current values. The display follows the update time interval you
  have set in the <cite>General</cite> pane
  of the preferences window. The output will appear
  additionally in the simulated <cite>Preview</cite> area in the lower left corner
  of the window.</p>
<p align="left">The output elements are sent to the display in top to bottom
  order. You can rearrange the elements by dragging them in the right-hand table
  into any order you like. The following elements are available for output on
  the external display: </p>
<ul>
  <li><cite>Text</cite>: free-form text of a fixed length. You can enter any
    text you like into the area <cite>Options for selected element</cite> after
    you have dragged a text element from the left to the right and the element
    is still selected. Note that Hardware Monitor accepts any valid characters
    for input, but most LC displays only support a limited character set. A character
    which cannot be displayed is automatically replaced by a filled block character.</li>
  <li><cite>New Line</cite>: causes the LC display to begin a new line at the
    position where this element is inserted. To avoid empty lines, Hardware Monitor
    automatically suppresses a &quot;new line&quot; command whenever the display
    would have automatically begun a new line, because the previous line was
    full.</li>
  <li><cite>Date</cite>: the current date. Hardware Monitor will automatically select
      an output format which follows your personal user preferences
      for the short display of date designations. To change this format, use
    the <cite>Formats</cite> section in the <cite>International</cite> pane of <cite>System Preferences</cite> and
    restart the application.</li>
  <li><cite>Time</cite>: the current time. Hardware Monitor will automatically select
      an output format
      which follows your personal user preferences for the short display
      of time designations including seconds. To change this format, use the <cite>Formats</cite> section
      in the <cite>International</cite> pane of <cite>System
      Preferences</cite> and restart the application.</li>
  <li><cite>Computer Name</cite>: the name of the local computer. This is the name
      configured via System Preferences, not a DNS name.</li>
  <li><cite>Kernel Version</cite>: the version designation of the kernel of the
      operating system.</li>
  <li><cite>OS Version</cite>: the version designation of Mac OS X.</li>
  <li><cite>OS Build</cite>: the build number of the running version of Mac OS X.</li>
  <li><cite>IPv4 address</cite>: the IP version 4 address of each physical
    network interface. The lefthand table will offer an entry for each detected
    network interface available. If the interface is not configured or loses
    its address, the value &quot;---.---.---.---&quot; will be displayed. </li>
  <li><cite>Sensor Value</cite>: the sensor reading for each currently active
    hardware sensor or artificial probe. Details for the way the display will
    represent the value can be configured in the area <cite>Options for selected
    element</cite>.
      See the paragraph below for more information.</li>
  <li><cite>Sensor Bar Graph</cite>: the sensor reading for each currently active
      hardware sensor or artificial probe which is representing a percentage
    value, e.g. CPU load or disk usage. The bar graph will grow from left to
    right, consuming 10 characters. The bar is represented by filled rectangular
    block characters. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">If you have selected a sensor or probe value for output, you
  can enter additional parameters at <cite>Options for selected element</cite>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><cite>Maximum field length</cite>: the number of characters which should
    be used on the LCD to display this sensor value, including decimal delimiter
      and unit. In order to avoid values to be shifted around the
      display, Hardware Monitor will always attempt to hold the length constant,
      even if the number of digits to display the value is changing. This also
      means a value will be cut off if the length you have selected is too small.
      The value &quot;12.34V&quot; consumes
      6 characters for example. If you select a field length of 4, only the part &quot;12.3&quot; will
      become visible on the display.</li>
  <li><cite>Digits after decimal delimiter</cite>: The number of digits which should
      be displayed after the decimal delimiter. Hardware Monitor will automatically
      round the values appropriately.</li>
  <li><cite>Show unit or &quot;OK/FAIL&quot; messages</cite>: The meaning of
    this switch is different depending on whether you have selected a physical
    sensor value, or a probe with a logical &quot;0/1&quot; value, for example a RAID status
    probe. For a physical sensor, a unit character will be displayed if this
    option is switched on. It will be omitted if the checkmark is removed. (Note
    that temperature values use a simple degree symbol as unit designation.)
    For a logical probe, setting this checkmark will enable a feature that automatically
    translates the value &quot;1&quot; to the output &quot;OK&quot; and the value of &quot;0&quot; to the output
    &quot;!!&quot;. If this option is switched off, logical values will not be translated
    into text.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no restrictions in the output elements you select. You can use several
  different text elements for example, or display the same sensor value twice,
  at two different locations on the LCD. Hardware Monitor won't warn you if
  you are creating more output than fits on the display.</p>
<h2>Using LCD units on an unattended computer </h2>
<p>It is necessary to have Hardware Monitor running in order to send values to
  the external LCD unit. However, if you log out, Mac OS X will automatically
  quit your running applications. This means Hardware Monitor will be shut down
  and the display will be switched off. This is not helpful if you want to
  monitor a server, which is usually running in unattended mode with no user
  being logged in at the main screen.</p>
<p>You can solve this problem as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download a copy of Hardware Monitor Remote. If running on the same computer
    for the same user, only one registration key is necessary to use both applications.
    (<a href="http://www.bresink.com/osx/HardwareMonitorRemote.html">http://www.bresink.com/osx/HardwareMonitorRemote.html</a>)</li>
  <li>Attach the LCD unit and use Hardware Monitor to configure the display.
    When the output works as desired, quit Hardware Monitor.</li>
  <li>Launch Hardware Monitor Remote on the same computer and user account, and
    use its import feature to import the current LCD configuration (together
    with the current probe configuration if necessary) from Hardware Monitor.
    See the reference manual of Hardware Monitor Remote for details.</li>
  <li>Start the background service of Hardware Monitor Remote. The background
    application will control the LCD unit, and the display will remain active
    even if you log out.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also configure Hardware Monitor Remote to start the background service
  automatically during startup of Mac OS X. In this case, the display will automatically
  be switched on when the operating system is started. It is not necessary that
  a user logs in.</p>
<p class="infocell">This feature cannot be supported for Logitech LCD products.
  These products require the Logitech LCD Manager software to run which is designed
  to work in a graphical user session only.</p>
<h2>Connecting and disconnecting running display units</h2>
<p>Hardware Monitor and Hardware Monitor Remote allow that you connect and disconnect
external LCD units while they are in use. The applications can identify each
  unit and will automatically stop or restart sending data to each unit, if the
  displays are disconnected or reconnected to the computer, respectively.</p>
<p class="infocell"><strong>Warning:</strong> Despite this feature, some versions
  of Mac OS X might not support this hot-swapping of devices! In the worst case,
  Mac OS X might crash with a kernel panic when you disconnect an LCD device
  in the middle of a running data transfer. This is a problem in the USB drivers
  of Mac OS X which cannot be prevented by Hardware Monitor. <strong>For this
  reason, it is recommended to disconnect LCD units only after you have quit
  the application which is controlling it. </strong></p>
