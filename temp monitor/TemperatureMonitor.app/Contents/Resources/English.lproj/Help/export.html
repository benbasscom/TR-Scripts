<p>The monitor application can export readings to text files. This way you can archive values or make them available to other persons or programs.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you like to export current readings, make sure the standard sensor window is on screen. If you want to export history data, open a history window with the requested values and set the desired mode and time interval.</li>
  <li>Click on the window containing the desired readings, making it the frontmost window.</li>
  <li>Select the menu item <cite>File &gt; Export Readings&#8230; </cite>or press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Enter a file name and select the desired file format. You can either store
    the readouts into a text file, or into a CSV file (comma-separated values)
    which is a common standard for transferring information into database or
    spreadsheet applications.</li>
</ol>
<p class="infocell">Readings not available are symbolized by a line of stars. In this case no reading was recorded in the affected time range because the monitor application was not running.</p>
<p>Date and time specifications are formatted complying with international ISO standards.</p>
