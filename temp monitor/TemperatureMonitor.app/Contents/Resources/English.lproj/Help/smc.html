<p>Some specific Mac models with Intel processors released after October 2008
  are affected by a technical problem which has influence on the system load
  the monitor application is consuming to perform its job. On such computers,
  the application may need considerably more processing power than usual.</p>
<p class="infocell">You don't need to read this chapter if you are using a PowerPC-based
  Mac, or a computer manufactured before October 2008.</p>
<p>All programs of the Hardware Monitor and Temperature Monitor application suite
  are optimized to execute their jobs without interfering with any other processes.
  They should consume almost no  resources for their monitoring work,
  so that nearly all processing power is left to your standard applications.
  You can perform the following test to verify if the monitor application works
  as expected:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Close all open windows in the monitor application. This includes the Screen
    Display feature. The menu-bar output and Dock icon can remain active.</li>
  <li>Open the <cite>Activity Monitor</cite> application from the <cite>Utilities</cite> folder in <cite>Applications</cite>.
    Ensure the window <cite>Activity Monitor</cite> is open.</li>
  <li>Click on the column <cite>CPU</cite> to sort all running processes by descending
    CPU load (highest values first). The values in the column represent the percentage
    of available processing time each process is currently consuming
    from the available amount of total processing time. The percentage is expressed
    relative to one processor. A sleeping process doing nothing has a value of
    0. A process consuming 10 percent of the computing power of 1 processor shows
    a value of 10. A process consuming all available processing power (100%)
    of 2 processors in a 2-core system shows a value of 200.</li>
  <li>Search for the monitoring application in the table. If you are monitoring
    a medium amount of sensors with the default refresh interval of 2 seconds,
    the CPU value should be less than 2%. If you are monitoring a high amount
    of sensors with a refresh interval of 1 second, the CPU value should be less
    than 4%.</li>
</ol>
<p>However,
    if the values are significantly higher (the CPU value is 10 or more), your
  system could be affected by the problem mentioned above.</p>
<p class="infocell">It is normal that the CPU load taken by the monitor process
  will increase if you have several windows open or enable the Screen Display
  feature. Refreshing all graphical contents in regular intervals needs continuous
  processing power.</p>
<h2>Technical background</h2>
<p>Intel-based Apple computers use a customized chip, the <strong>Apple
    System Management Controller (SMC)</strong>, to collect  data from most sensors,
    to control the fans, and to perform other services necessary to manage the
    computer. The central processor communicates with the SMC over
    a special internal data line.</p>
<p>On specific computer models, this communication bus to transfer data to and
  from the SMC appears to be relatively slow, so the main CPU sometimes has to
  wait for data to arrive at the other end of the communication line. If a lot
  of data has to be transferred over the SMC bus, access has to be delayed and
  to be coordinated very often when the communication line is busy.</p>
<p>Applications like Hardware Monitor and Temperature Monitor need to communicate
  with the SMC to get updated values from the system's sensors, so they have
  to use the SMC bus very intensively. <strong>On certain systems,
  Mac OS X forces the monitor applications to spend an unusually high amount
  of processing power for actively coordinating access to the SMC bus.</strong> This
  causes the affected application to consume much more active CPU time for SMC
  communication. Note that such an application cannot control access to the SMC
  via its own code. It has to use services and drivers of Mac OS X to do that.
  The processing time is consumed by indirectly called code parts within the
  Mac OS X kernel, not by code of the monitor application itself.</p>
<p>It is currently unknown if this effect is caused by a general design flaw
  in the bus hardware of specific chipsets, or by immature drivers
  in current versions of Mac OS X.</p>
<h2>Optimizing SMC access</h2>
<p>To avoid the problem that the monitor application may need an unusually high
  amount of processor performance to receive data from SMC-controlled sensors,
  the application can be configured to reduce SMC communication. Please note
  that not all sensors are operated by the SMC.</p>
<p class="infocell">To check whether a specific sensor is controlled via the
  SMC, open the <cite>Sensor
  Overview</cite> window in the application and double-click the table row of
  the sensor in question. If the line <cite>Hardware</cite> in the sensor's detail
  information window shows the result <cite>Apple
  System Management Controller</cite>, each access to this sensor will require
  SMC communication.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/SMCPanel.png" alt="Optimizing access to the System Management Controller" width="520" height="359" /></p>
<p>If you like to optimize access to the System Management Controller, please
  do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the menu item <cite>Monitor &gt; Optimize sensor access performanceâ€¦</cite>.</li>
  <li>Check the value displayed at <cite>Reduced access rate recommended</cite> in
    the middle of the window. If the value is <cite>No</cite>, your computer
    appears not to be affected by the problem. If the value is <cite>Yes</cite>,
    you should reduce the rate at which SMC-controlled sensors are being updated.</li>
  <li>Use the slider to select between one of the available access rates. For
    a <cite>No</cite> value, select <cite>normal access</cite>, for a <cite>Yes</cite> value,
    select one of the reduced rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the setting <cite>normal</cite>, the application will access the SMC
    sensors whenever it needs to. With the setting <cite>reduced</cite>, the
    application ensures to avoid accessing each SMC-controlled sensor more than
    once within a time interval of 10 seconds. At <cite>very reduced</cite>,
    access to each SMC sensor will be guaranteed to occur no more than once per
    minute.</p>
<p>When reducing the access rate, the time resolution of the measurements taken
  for SMC sensors won't be as accurate as before. The values recorded in the
  sensor history appear to remain constant within the access time interval. When
  displaying a history graph, the curves won't be as smooth in vertical direction,
  they will be more &quot;stepped&quot;. Sensors not controlled by the SMC are not affected
  by the access rate setting.</p>
