    <p><strong>Monitoring GPU sensors on computers which have two independent
        switchable graphics units is not officially supported by the
        application:</strong> Some specific Apple computers come with two
      alternative GPU solutions: One energy-saving graphics processor inside the
      main processor and one high-performance graphics processor on an external
      chip. Such computer models show the option <cite>Automatic graphics
        switching</cite> (or similar) in the pane <cite><span>Energy Saver</span></cite>
      of <cite>System Preferences</cite>. If the option is active, which is the
      recommended default setting, the computer may change GPUs during
      operation, switching one graphics processor off and the other graphics
      processor on. All sensors of the GPU currently powered down will also
      become inactive. Due to architectural problems, there can be unexpected
      side effects in the application when you monitor such sensors.</p>
    <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> We don't recommend to monitor any of the GPU
      sensors for such computer models. Identify all graphics processor sensors
      in the pane <cite>Sensors</cite> of the <cite>Preferences</cite> panel
      of the application and set the check mark <cite>Data query: Don't acquire
        readings from this sensor</cite> for each of them.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>After starting the program, I receive a warning that some
        resources have been damaged. Even when I download a fresh copy from the
        distribution site, the problem persists and I cannot use the
        application:</strong> On particular operating system installations, a
      warning panel with the message "Warning: The resources of this application
      have been damaged" may appear although the program bundle is authentic.</p>
    <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> This problem is caused by a security hole
      detected by the application. When a security problem is found, the program
      uses an error message which may mistakenly indicate that its own resources
      are damaged although critical permission settings in the operating system
      are damaged instead. Some bad installers for low-level UNIX applications
      are known to cause such a defect. You can repair the system as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Quit the application if it is still open and displaying the error
        message.</li>
      <li>Open the application <cite>Terminal</cite> from the folder <cite>Utilities</cite>.</li>
      <li>Enter the following two commands exactly as shown (or better use
        copy/paste), pressing the return key after each line:</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>sudo chown -R root:wheel /usr/bin<br />
        sudo chmod -R go-w /usr/bin</code></p>
    <p> The program should launch correctly after performing these steps. The
      security hole opened by the third-party installer will also have been
      closed.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>After upgrading to Mac OS X 10.7.4, the sensors named "Battery 1
        Cell x" may be shown as being disconnected:</strong> Mac OS X 10.7.4 is
      not capable of accessing voltage data of individual battery cells. When
      running this OS version, such sensors will no longer be available. Other
      versions of Mac OS X are not affected.</p>
    <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> This is a known defect of Mac OS X 10.7.4
      and there is no workaround. The problem is caused by a defective version
      of the battery driver which is shipped with Mac OS X 10.7.4. We have made
      Apple aware of this problem and hope they will fix it in future versions
      of the operating system.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>When using a MacBook Pro of the "Early 2011" model series (having
        identification codes beginning with "MacBookPro8"), the system might
        return invalid hardware information:</strong> Apple computers of the
      model series MacBook Pro 13-inch (Early 2011), MacBook Pro 15-inch (Early
      2011), and MacBook Pro 17-inch (Early 2011) are originally shipped with a
      special release of Mac OS X, known as version 10.6.6 Build 10J3210, and
      the firmware version MBP81.88Z.0047.B04. Both components appear to be
      immature, not supporting all aspects of the MacBook Pro computers
      correctly yet. The systems might return incorrect information about
      technical details of the processor package and contain invalid entries in
      their System Management data. Applications such as Hardware Monitor or
      Temperature Monitor depend on the operating system to respond correctly on
      hardware information requests. The following details could be display
      incorrectly: number of processor cores per processor package, system bus
      clock frequency, bus widths of memory chips, onboard devices, available
      expansion slots. This list might not be complete.</p>
    <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> There is no known workaround. Apple might or
      might not resolve these problems with future versions of Mac OS X and the
      MBP81 firmware. It is Apple's policy not to comment on any technical
      details of Intel-based computers.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>When running monitoring utilities of other vendors which also
        access S.M.A.R.T. features of hard drives, Hardware Monitor and
        Temperature Monitor can be blocked from accessing S.M.A.R.T. readings:</strong>
      Certain low-quality monitoring applications of third-party vendors are
      known to reserve exclusive access to the S.M.A.R.T. interfaces of hard
      drives. When running such applications, neither Hardware Monitor, nor
      Temperature Monitor, nor other applications, like Apple's Disk Utility or
      System Profiler, can access any S.M.A.R.T. features until the misbehaving
      application is quit. S.M.A.R.T. sensors or probes show a value of "---",
      the Drive Overview window shows "S.M.A.R.T. status: not available".</p>
    <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Either disable S.M.A.R.T. monitoring in the
      third-party application, or contact its vendor to have the problem
      resolved. It is bad practice to use exclusive access to the S.M.A.R.T.
      interfaces of hard drives.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>After waking from sleep mode, the Main Logic Board Air Inlet
        sensor of some Power Macintosh G5 Dual Core systems shows negative or no
        readings:</strong> When a dual core PowerMac G5 wakes from sleep mode,
      the temperature reading of the air inlet sensor may show incorrect values.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> This is a known defect in specific versions
      of Mac OS X Tiger. This particular sensor is not correctly woken up by the
      operating system. We have made Apple aware of this problem and hope they
      will resolve it in future versions of Mac OS X. In the meantime, you can
      restart the computer to reset the sensor hardware, or disable data
      acquisition for this sensor in the preferences of the application.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Computers of the model series "iMac (Late 2006)" may show
        unusually high readings for the CPU A Current Sensor:</strong> When you
      are using an Apple iMac with model identification "iMac5,1", the values
      displayed for the current (amperage) sensor of the CPU appear to be too
      high and inconsistent with CPU power readings.</p>
    <p><strong>Workaround: </strong>This is a known problem with the System
      Management Controller (SMC) used in this particular model series. (Other
      iMac series are not affected by this problem.) It is unknown if Apple will
      release an SMC firmware update to fix this problem. You might like to
      disable data acquisition for this sensor in the preferences section of the
      application.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>In certain configurations, the entry "Logitech LCD Manager" may
        not be displayed in the list of LCD devices, even if a Logitech product
        with LCD support is connected to the computer (Hardware Monitor only):</strong>
      Although you have attached a Logitech LCD product and installed the
      Logitech driver software, no device entry for this product appears in the
      preferences panel of Hardware Monitor. The display does not work and
      cannot be configured.</p>
    <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> The Logitech LCD Manager software does not
      start reliably under specific circumstances. In this case, applications
      are not able to see or connect to the respective LC displays. Not only
      Hardware Monitor, but all applications trying to use LCD-enabled Logitech
      devices are affected by this problem. Try the following to start the LCD
      Manager manually:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Launch <cite>Activity Monitor</cite> (from the folder <cite>/Applications/Utitilies</cite>),
        select the process called <cite>LCDManager</cite>, and press the stop
        button to force-quit it.</li>
      <li>Check if the file <cite>~/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/com.logitech.lcdmon.xxx
          </cite>exists in your home folder ("xxx" is an arbitrary number which
        can vary.) If yes, delete this file by dragging it to the Trash.</li>
      <li>Open the pane <cite>LCD Manager</cite> in <cite>System Preferences</cite>.
        This should start a working copy of Logitech LCD Manager.</li>
      <li>Quit and relaunch Hardware Monitor.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Logitech might resolve this problem in future versions of their driver
      software.</p>
