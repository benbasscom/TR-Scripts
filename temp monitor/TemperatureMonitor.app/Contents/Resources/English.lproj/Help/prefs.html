<h2>General settings</h2>
<p>To customize the program to your specific needs, you can set a great variety
  of defaults and preferences. You can access these settings via the main menu
  and its item <cite>Preferences&#8230;</cite> or by pressing the key combination <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd>.
  The settings are subdivided into eight areas which will be discussed in detail
  later. The basic preferences which are independent of the computer model you
  are using, are displayed in the <cite>General</cite>  pane.</p>
<p>The  pop-up menu at <cite>Temperature Unit</cite> selects which unit the application
  shall use to display temperature data. You can select between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>degrees Celsius</li>
  <li>degrees Fahrenheit</li>
  <li>Kelvin</li>
  <li>combination of Celsius and Fahrenheit</li>
  <li>combination of Fahrenheit and Celsius</li>
</ul>
<p class="infocell"><strong>Note:</strong> A combination of multiple units is not supported in the graphical history display and when exporting history data. In these cases, the first unit of the combination will be used.</p>
<p>When launching the application, it has to analyze the sensor equipment of
  your computer, which can be a lengthy task depending on the hardware devices
  you are using and the number of additional remote systems you are monitoring.
  The program displays a wait message in a small window while the necessary preparations
  take place. As soon as the window disappears, the application will be fully
  operational. If you don't like such windows, you can disable it using the
  check mark at <cite>Splash Window: Suppress wait message when starting the
  application.</cite></p>
<p>The setting <cite>Graph display</cite> selects how the scales of the vertical
  axes in history graphs will be computed. The item <cite>Use natural scale</cite> will
  display each axis beginning at zero. The selection <cite>Zoom into current
  value range</cite> will  display the graph in such a way that the value range
  visible in the selected history interval covers 90 percent of the graph's height.
  Small details can be detected much better, but the displayed curve may tend
  to display small changes and measurement errors in an exaggerated fashion.</p>
<p>By default, time values shown on the horizontal axes of the history graphs
  are labeled using time designations relative to the present time, e.g. &quot;42
  minutes ago&quot;. You can alternatively display absolute time readings like &quot;8:42:15
  am&quot; by setting the option <cite>Use absolute time designations</cite>. </p>
<p>Three options are available in the area <cite>Remote monitoring :</cite></p>
<ul><li>The option <cite>Reconnect to previously connected remote computers at
      startup</cite> controls
      whether the application should automatically contact the same set of remote
      computers that had been connected the last time you used
      the application. Without further manual
      intervention being necessary, the same computers that had been in use before
      will be connected again. Note that the remote computers must be switched
      on and cannot be in sleep mode for the reconnect attempt to be successful.
      You won't receive a warning if the attempt fails.</li>
  <li>Set a checkmark at <cite>Don't notify when remote computers enter sleep mode</cite> if
      you don't want to receive a warning when the application is losing contact
      to a remote computer because that computer entered sleep mode. </li>
</ul>
<p>The preference setting <cite>Battery current</cite> is available for Hardware
  Monitor only. It is not displayed in Temperature Monitor. The setting controls
  what policy the application should follow when displaying and recording amperage
  values for battery units. Some versions of Mac OS X and certain battery units
  allow that the sign of amperage value reflects whether the battery is currently
  charging or discharging. So a current of 1.5 amps can be displayed as <cite>1.5
  A</cite> if the current flows from battery to computer, and as <cite>-1.5 A</cite> when
  the same current flows in the opposite direction from computer to battery.
  Press the button at <cite>Always use positive numbers for battery currents</cite>,
  if you want to make sure the values are always greater than 0. Select the option <cite>Use
  different signs when charging/discharging if supported</cite> when you like
  to allow the sign to change. Note that some battery units and some older versions
  of Mac OS X are unable to support this. </p>
<p>The sliders displayed under <cite>Update Interval</cite> control how often
  the application will perform the measurements. It also controls how often the
  displayed values are updated. You can select between different time intervals
  ranging from one second to one hour. The recommended update interval is 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Separated from the general update preference is the time interval for requests sent to hard disk sensors. Some hard disk models may temporarily go into diagnostic mode or move their read/write heads when the sensors are read out, so it is no recommended to make the update interval too short. Otherwise, repeated queries to the sensors might reduce performance of your hard disk(s).</p>
<p>Note that access to disk sensors built into the drives themselves
  will be interpreted as &quot;user activity&quot; by the drives. If you have enabled sleep
  mode for hard drives in Mac OS X, monitoring these sensors could cause your
  drives to no longer enter sleep mode as expected. For this reason, the application
  contains a <cite>Disk Saver</cite> feature: When you are inactive and the computer
  is not really in use for some period of time, the program can automatically
  stop all sensor communication with your hard drive(s). This allows the standard
  sleep feature of the hard drives to become active. Set the pop-up menu at <cite>Disk
  Saver</cite> to
  the desired time interval.</p>
<p class="infocell">The Disk Saver feature in the application is intentionally independent of
  your personal Energy Saver preferences of Mac OS X. </p>

<h2>Storing display mode and window positions</h2>
<p>In addition to the general preference settings, the application automatically remembers which output windows you have used for the display of readings. This includes the position of the windows on screen. You don't need to care about those settings. The next time you are starting the application, it will automatically restore the state that was effective the last time you have used the program.</p>
<h2>Machine-specific settings in a network</h2>
<p>If you are using the monitor program as &quot;roaming user&quot; on different computers in a network, and your private folder is located on a common file server (which is a standard setup in large companies and schools), the software is able to remember machine-specific settings for each computer and computer type you have used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you launch the program later on exactly the same computer (with identical sensor equipment), the application will automatically use the preferences you had set earlier.</li>
  <li>If you launch the program later on a similar computer (of the same type,
    with a sensor equipment that might be identical but also could be different),
    the application will automatically ask whether you want to take over preference
    settings that have been stored for a different computer. A list of available
    settings of compatible computers you have used will be displayed. You can
    alternatively choose not to reuse any settings but begin with a fresh new
  set of preferences for this computer.</li>
  <li>If you launch the program on a machine type which you have never used before, the application will automatically use a fresh set of preference values for this computer (because the sensor equipment is probably very different from that of other computers). You will not lose any preference settings stored for other  models.</li>
</ul>
<p class="infocell">The settings in <cite>General</cite> and <cite>Sensors</cite> become
  valid for all of your computers, all other preference areas are defined individually
  per each computer, when you are roaming between them. </p>
