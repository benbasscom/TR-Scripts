<h2>The System Information window </h2>
<p>The monitor program can display detailed technical information about your
  computer. Select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show system info</cite> or
  press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>.
  Among the displayed items are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apple model code and name of the computer type</li>
  <li>serial number of the unit</li>
  <li>unique identification code of the unit. This code is similar to a serial
    number and is used by Mac OS X to identify  computers.</li>
  <li>Production date and place (if available)</li>
  <li>type and number of processors</li>
  <li>64 bit capability of the processors</li>
  <li>nominal, maximum, minimum and current clock frequencies of processor and
    memory bus</li>
  <li>size of main memory and cache units</li>
  <li>operating system and system kernel version</li>
  <li>information whether the kernel is operating in 32 or 64 bit mode</li>
  <li>boot ROM version</li>
</ul>
<p>If your computer is equipped with self-contained micro-processing units (MPUs)
- this is the case for the top models of the Power Mac G5 series -, or if you
  are using an Intel-based Macintosh system, you can open a detail sheet which
  gives you  more information. To open the additional info panel, press the
  button <cite>More
  Info&hellip;</cite>. If your computer has a built-in system management database
  compliant with  industry standards, pressing the button <cite>Management Info&hellip;</cite>  will
  open a second detail panel with other types of information (see below).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/SysInfo.png" alt="System Information" width="460" height="598" /></p>
<h2>The MPU information sheet (systems with MPU cards only) </h2>
<p>The detail sheet on computers using MPU cards has the following
  information available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>card slot number</li>
  <li>number of processors per unit</li>
  <li>lot and part numbers of processors</li>
  <li>serial number of the unit and its parent main logic board</li>
  <li>cooling parameters for this unit</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/MPUInfo.png" alt="Micro Processor Unit Card Info" width="407" height="265" /></p>
<p align="left">If your computer is equipped with multiple MPU cards, each board can be selected by the navigation buttons in the upper right corner.</p>
<h2 align="left">The information sheet for x86 processors</h2>
<p align="left">If your computer uses a processor of the x86 architecture (Intel-based
  Macintosh systems), pressing the <cite>More Info</cite> button will give you the following
  information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the identification of the processor typically used when communicating
      the name to end customers (marketing name) </li>
  <li>the true internal identification of the processor</li>
  <li>family, model, and stepping numbers</li>
  <li>the number of processor cores per processor package. This can include virtual
    cores.</li>
  <li>information about Intel® Turbo Boost: When some of the cores within a multi-core
    processor are powered down, because there is currently not enough to do to
    keep all cores busy, modern processors make use of a feature to accelerate
    the remaining cores. Because not all parts of the CPU chip are active in
    this case, there is enough headroom to draw more power and to produce more
    heat than normal, making safe overclocking possible. The maximum clock frequencies
    depending on the number of active cores (or hardware threads) are shown in
    the table. If you are using a processor without this acceleration feature,
    only the line <cite>all</cite>    with
    the nominal clock frequency will be displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/x86Details.png" alt="x86 Detail Info" width="508" height="301" /> </p>
<p align="left">If your computer is equipped with multiple processor packages,
  each unit can be selected by the navigation buttons in the upper right corner.</p>
<h2 align="left">The System Management Information sheet (computers with Intel-based
  architecture only)</h2>
<p align="left">The detail sheet on computers containing a system management
  table has the following information available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>data about the system unit</li>
  <li>detail information on each processor</li>
  <li>detail information on each cache unit</li>
  <li>detail information on each memory slot or memory device</li>
  <li>data abour the system's firmware</li>
  <li>management data regarding the system board</li>
  <li>management data regarding the system enclosure</li>
  <li>detail information about each connector on the system board and/or
      system enclosure</li>
  <li>detail information on each expansion slot</li>
  <li>list of built-in system devices</li>
  <li>list of jumpers and switches on the system board</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/SMInfo.png" alt="System Management Information" width="862" height="376" /></p>
<p>If your computer is equipped with multiple processors, cache units, or memory
  slots, you can navigate between the different objects by pressing the arrow
  buttons in the upper left corner of the sheet. </p>
<h2 align="left">Displaying battery information</h2>
<p align="left">When using the full version of Hardware Monitor you can also
  get detailed information about the batteries used. Select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show
  battery info</cite> or press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd>. Hardware Monitor will
  use different types of display panels depending on whether you are using up-to-date
  battery units or not. In any case, the following information will be shown:</p>
<ul>
  <li>current voltage</li>
  <li>current amperage</li>
  <li>total capacity, the maximum amount the battery can reach with
    its current age when you fully charge it</li>
  <li>current capacity, the present charge</li>
  <li>the maximum capacity this type of battery originally supported, as designed
    by the factory</li>
</ul>
<p>The following two items are only available for specific battery units and
  can be displayed only when using certain operating system versions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>number of charge/discharge cycles</li>
  <li>current mode of operation and state</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">On computers equipped with multiple battery slots, data for each
  unit is available. You can select between different battery units using the
  navigation buttons in the upper right corner of the window. If your battery
  unit is compliant with the industry standard for &quot;smart batteries&quot;,
  you can press the button <cite>Details&hellip;</cite> to
  display additional manufacturing data like vendor, serial number, or production
date. The following example shows the battery panel for an older PowerBook battery
  unit:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/Battery.png" alt="Battery information" width="450" height="372" /></p>
<p align="left">In case your battery unit is compliant with the Smart Battery
  industry standard, and you are using an Intel-based system with Mac
  OS X 10.4.9 or a later version, Hardware Monitor will use a panel like this
  to display the battery information:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/SmartBattery.png" alt="Smart Battery Information" width="600" height="435" /></p>
<p>This panel additionally shows the current temperature of the battery and the
  individual voltages for each cell if the unit discloses this information. The
  current charge is displayed by a bar graph, as well as the comparison between
  the current total capacity and the original  capacity, which is characteristic
  for the health of your battery. It is normal that the battery  will wear
  out with use after time, so the maximum capacity will decrease in relation
  to the capacity &quot;as designed&quot; when the battery was new.</p>
<p>The battery unit may no longer work correctly if one battery cell shows a
  voltage very different from the voltages of the remaining cells. This is a
  good indication that the battery has reached the end of its life and should
  be replaced.</p>
<h2>Displaying disk monitoring data</h2>
<p>Depending on your computer and the version of Mac OS X it is running, the
  operating system might monitor the correct function of all connected hard disks
  to predict whether a disk drive could fail. This function is based on a feature
called S.M.A.R.T.</p>
<p>S.M.A.R.T. is the abbreviation of <em>Self Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting
    Technology .</em> It is an industry standard introduced in 1992 to react
    earlier on hard disk failures. A hard disk supporting the S.M.A.R.T. standard
    monitors itself with its own micro processor and allows the operating system
    to request information if technical parameters have changed in such a way
    that the hard disk might become defective in the near future. In this case
    the hard disk can be replaced before any data is lost.</p>
<p>S.M.A.R.T. is available for all up-to-date hard disk drives that are connected
  via an ATA or SATA interface. To display the current status of your drives
  select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show Drive Overview</cite> or press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>8</kbd>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/DriveOverview.png" alt="Drive Overview Window" width="698" height="206" /></p>
<p>The
    columns in the table have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
  <li><cite>Drive:</cite> The name of the disk  unit as specified by the drive.
    Note that the vendor and drive names might be abbreviated because the identification
    texts are limited in length for technical reasons. For example, a drive might
    identify as
    &quot;MATSHITA&quot; although the correct vendor name is &quot;Matsushita
    Kotobuki Electronics (Panasonic)&quot;.</li>
  <li><cite>Serial number:</cite> The serial number of the drive. The application will display
      the number for S.M.A.R.T.-supporting drives only.</li>
  <li><cite>Protocol:</cite> The bus protocol used to talk to the drive unit.</li>
  <li><cite>S.M.A.R.T.:</cite> shows whether this drive is currently capable
    of supporting the <em>Self
    Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology </em>standard. Note that some
    protocols are unable to transport S.M.A.R.T. data, so a drive unit capable
    of supporting S.M.A.R.T. might  not support it in the current situation because
    it is connected via an incompatible protocol.</li>
  <li><cite>Status:</cite> shows the diagnostic status of the disk drive. <cite>Verified</cite> means
    the diagnostic processor of the drive unit has checked the drive with the
    result that all operating parameters are within normal conditions, diagnosing
    the drive to be OK. <cite>Failing</cite> means the diagnostic processor is
    predicting a failure of the drive in the near future. In this case you should
    replace the drive as soon as possible. <cite>Not available</cite> means no
    diagnostic info is available because the drive cannot support S.M.A.R.T.</li>
  <li><cite>LED</cite>: If you are not sure which drive of your system is identified
    by which model code and serial number, but the drives are equipped with activity
    lights (LEDs), the monitor application can help you to identify the drives:
    When pressing the button <cite>Test</cite>, the  drive identified in that
    respective line will light up its activity LED for one second. The <cite>Test</cite> button
    can only be pressed for drives which have readable media online.</li>
</ul>
<p class="infocell">The table does not update automatically because continuous monitoring would
  slow down all drives. If you want to make sure the table is up-to-date, close,
  then reopen the window. </p>
<h2>Displaying hard disk monitoring data for Xserve computers </h2>
<p>The S.M.A.R.T. verification status explained in the previous section allows
  you to check whether the disk drives are OK. The status is based on information
  acquired by the diagnostic processor of the drive unit's controller. In some
  cases the detail data on which the verification status is based can be monitored
  as well. Mac OS X is doing this automatically for Apple Xserve computers. </p>
<p> Select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show Xserve Disk Info</cite> or press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>7</kbd>. A
  window like the following will be displayed:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/Xserve.png" alt="Hard Disk Monitoring Information" width="550" height="336" /></p>
<p align="left">Under normal circumstances, this feature is only available if
  all of the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are using an Apple Xserve computer.</li>
  <li>You are using original Apple hard drives, manufactured for the
      Xserve. </li>
  <li>The computer is running Mac OS X Server.</li>
</ul>
<p>On computers equipped with multiple monitored disk drives, data for each unit
  is available. You can select between different drives using the navigation
  buttons in the upper right corner of the window.</p>
<p>The table shows the following
    information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><cite>S.M.A.R.T. Attribute</cite>: The name of the attribute monitored
    by the drive's processor. This name is defined by the disk manufacturer and
    is not interpreted by Mac OS X or Hardware Monitor.</li>
  <li><cite>Current</cite>: The current value of the attribute, as measured by the drive.
    The meaning of the value is defined by the disk manufacturer. Higher values
    mean better performance or reliability.</li>
  <li><cite>Worst</cite>: The worst value of the attribute that has been recorded during the
      drive's lifetime.</li>
  <li><cite>Threshold</cite>: The threshold value for the attribute, as defined
    by the disk manufacturer. If the measured value is equal or below the threshold,
    this will indicate a problem with the drive.</li>
  <li><cite>Status</cite>: The interpretation of the current attribute value.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three possible cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><cite>OK</cite>: the monitored attribute is within specifications for this drive.</li>
  <li><cite>Failure imminent</cite>: the disk drive has detected a problem, because the
                currently measured value does not fall within specifications.
    A failure of the disk drive could be imminent. The drive should be replaced
        as soon as possible.</li>
  <li><cite>Lifetime exceeded</cite>: the currently measured value indicates that the drive
                  has exceeded the lifetime it had been designed for. It is recommended
              to replace the drive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Showing information about connected screen displays</h2>
<p>This feature is only available in Hardware Monitor, not in Temperature Monitor.
  The application can try to identify all  displays currently connected
  to the system. Select the menu item <cite>Window &gt; Show Display Info</cite>,
  or press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>9</kbd>. The following data about each display unit
  should become accessible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the identification code of the manufacturer</li>
  <li>the plug-and-play identification code of the display model</li>
  <li>the readable product name</li>
  <li>additional info on the product (if provided by the manufacturer)</li>
  <li>the manufacturing date or the model year of the product (if provided)</li>
  <li>the serial number of the display (may not be provided, or may not match
    the printed serial number for some manufacturers)</li>
</ul>
<p class="infocell">The amount of information provided will vary between different
  display vendors. This feature will not work with monitors built before 1995.
  In case you are using a display cable not compliant with VESA standards, or
  the signal is routed through a switch or similar device, neither Mac OS X nor
  Hardware Monitor may be capable of identifying the display.</p>
<p>If multiple displays are connected, you can switch between them using the
  buttons in the upper right corner. When connecting or disconnecting cables
  for external monitors, you should close and reopen the information window to
ensure you are getting up-to-date information. An example is shown in the following
picture:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/DisplayInfo.png" alt="Display Info Panel" width="448" height="228" /></p>
<p class="infocell">Display units built into mobile Apple computers usually identify
  themselves as &quot;Color LCDs&quot; built by 'APP' (Apple Inc.). However, in
  most cases, the true part number of the original manufacturer is disclosed
  in the line <cite>Additional Info</cite>. If you search for this part number
  on the Internet, you will be able to identify the true vendor of the display
  unit. In the example above, it would be <cite>LTN154BT</cite>, a display panel
  manufactured by SAMSUNG.</p>
