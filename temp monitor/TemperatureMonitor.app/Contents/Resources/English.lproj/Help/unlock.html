    <p class="infocell">This page is not applicable to Temperature Monitor.</p>
    <p>Hardware Monitor is electronically distributed software which is offered
      following a “First try, then buy” principle. You can download the
      application free of charge and test whether it fits your needs. During the
      test phase, the following limitations apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A window with the note <cite>Running in Demo Mode</cite> appears each
        time the application is started. It gives you a detailed recommendation
        whether Hardware Monitor would offer more information on the current
        computer than the free Temperature Monitor.</li>
      <li>The application displays readings from temperature sensors only. All
        other types of sensors are ignored.</li>
      <li>There are no other limitations regarding the functionality of the
        software.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you like to use the software permanently, you'll have to place an
      order for the needed number of usage licenses. For each license you will
      receive a so-called <em>registration code</em> by e-mail which will allow
      you to switch the application from demo mode to normal operation.</p>
    <p>Distributing or leasing the application to third parties is prohibited
      without prior written permission. The exact contractual obligations for
      licensing the software can be displayed and printed after you have opened
      the downloaded software package.</p>
    <h2>Ordering registration codes</h2>
    <p>Placing an order for registration codes of Hardware Monitor is possible
      via our distribution partner. The order can be placed via Internet, postal
      mail, telefax or phone. The computer on which the application should be
      used does not need to have an Internet link necessarily. It is only
      necessary that you somehow receive the e-mail message used to deliver the
      registration code. Delivery is possible worldwide. Payments are accepted
      in more than 40 different international currencies, with all common
      payment options supported.</p>
    <p>To learn more about placing orders, please use the following Internet
      page of Hardware Monitor:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.bresink.com/osx/216202/order.html">External Internet
        page with detailed order information</a></p>
    <p>For first written information, you can alternatively select the menu item
      <cite>Help &gt; Purchase Registration Key…</cite> in the application.</p>
    <h2>Unlocking the software</h2>
    <p>The registration code needed to unlock the software will be delivered via
      e-mail. Please note that this code represents a value and should be
      archived at a safe place for future reference, e.g. by printing it on
      paper. The code consists of two parts, the <em>Registration Name</em> and
      the <em>Registration Key</em>.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to login as an administrator when unlocking the
      sotware. In this case it is possible to not only unlock the application
      for a single user, but for all user accounts of the current computer.
      Perform the following steps to unlock the application for unrestricted
      usage:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the menu item <cite>Hardware Monitor &gt; Unlock Hardware
          Monitor…</cite>. The window <cite>MBS Product Registration</cite>
        will appear. It shows the current status of the registration.</li>
      <li>In this window press the button <cite>Add Key…</cite>. A sheet for
        entry of the registration code will appear.</li>
      <li>Transfer the registration name exactly as you have received it into
        the field <cite>Registration name</cite>. You can enter the data
        manually. However, if you currently have the registration e-mail on the
        same computer, it will be easier to transfer the data by the features <cite>Edit
          &gt; Copy</cite> (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) and <cite>Edit &gt;
          Paste</cite> (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>) into the application. Please
        pay attention not to transfer any additional blanks or empty lines. Also
        note that the contents of this field is case-sensitive.</li>
      <li>With the same method transfer the registration key into the field <cite>Registration
          key </cite>of the application.</li>
      <li>Use the buttons at <cite>Valid for</cite> to select whether you like
        the registration to become active for the current user account only or
        for all users of this computer.</li>
      <li>Press the button <cite>Save</cite>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If both parts of the code have been entered correctly, the window <cite>MBS
        Product Registration</cite> will show the successful unlock operation
      and the type of your license. You can close the window. If some part of
      the code has been entered incorrectly, an error message will be displayed
      and the sheet will open again to correct the problem. In this case please
      check both parts of the code for exact match with the e-mail which has
      been sent to you.</p>
    <p class="infocell">When using Mac OS X 10.7 or later, Apple no longer
      allows that a standard application (like Hardware Monitor) can perform
      operations on behalf of all users. For this reason, it won't be possible
      to unlock Hardware Monitor with the option <cite>Valid for: All users of
        this computer</cite> on such an operating system.</p>
    <h2>Deactivate the registration</h2>
    <p>You can deactivate the registration any time. Please perform the
      following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the menu item <cite>Hardware Monitor &gt; Unlock Hardware
          Monitor…</cite>.</li>
      <li>Choose the registration in the table.</li>
      <li>Press the button <cite>Remove key</cite>.</li>
    </ol>
